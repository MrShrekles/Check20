                <p>Curses add an exciting layer of strategy, tension, depth, and complexity to gameplay. By placing
                    a
                    curse on a character or item, players must weigh the risk versus reward of using it or
                    benefiting
                    from the curse's effects. While curses can grant powerful abilities or bonuses, they often come
                    with
                    significant drawbacks, creating a dynamic gameplay experience. Curses are not always malicious;
                    they
                    can stem from angels, tech lords, or other sources, adding an element of unpredictability and

                <p>Curses work similarly to Paths and Talents. Players can spend <strong>XP</strong> to gain
                    features from a curse, often
                    at a steep cost. Some curses require players to acquire bane features before unlocking powerful
                    boons. Curses offer a blend of complexity and customization, allowing characters to evolve
                    uniquely.

                                    languages, creating discomfort and distraction. However, these scripts faintly
                                    illuminate the area around you, providing a soft light in darkness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lingering Echo:</strong> Every spell you cast leaves an echo in your

                                    for a short time, revealing your spellcasting to those who can interpret it. On

                                    flip side, your understanding of spell echoes sharpens, granting advantage on

                                    checks related to identifying spells.</li>
                                <li><strong>Wordbound:</strong> Each spell inscribed on your body pulses with power
                                    when
                                    a corresponding spell is cast nearby, causing discomfort but alerting you to the

                                    you to see and hear things others can't. You gain advantage on Observation

                                    magic. When you cast a spell that matches an inscription on your body, its

                                    increases, adding a bonus to the damage or healing amount.</li>

                                    peak, creating a barrier around you. You gain immunity to one damage type of a
                                    spell
                                    inscribed on your body.</li>
                                <li><strong>Echoing Shield:</strong> Your inscriptions pulse with power whenever a
                                    spell
                                    targets you. As a reaction, gain immunity to damage from spells until the end of

                            its rage-infused power, they morph pain into a formidable strength.</p>

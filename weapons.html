                    <h1> Weapons </h1>
                    <h3> Weapons and Customization </h3>
                    <p>
                        Weapons in Check20 are intentionally non-specific. They represent categories of combat tools
                        rather than
                        fixed items. This gives players creative freedom to describe and flavor their weapons while
                        keeping the
                        mechanics streamlined. Work with your Narrator to define what your weapon looks like, sounds
                        like, and
                        how it fits into your character’s story.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you’ve chosen a weapon, assign it to the proper category, and lock in its damage type based
                        on what
                        it is. A longsword would be a Standard Melee weapon with Slashing damage. A warhammer would be
                        Impact,
                        and a pick would deal Piercing. This applies across the board.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Check Damage:</strong>
                            If a weapon lists <code>Check</code> for damage, deal damage equal to your total in the specified check instead of rolling dice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a weapon's damage includes an exclamation mark (e.g., <code>4d4!</code>), it uses <strong>exploding dice</strong>.
                            This means that for every die rolled at its maximum value, you roll an additional die of the same type and add it to the total.
                            This can repeat indefinitely as long as max values keep being rolled.
                        </p>

                About the Rank
            </summary>
            <h2>Divine Ranks</h2>
            <p>
                In Shek, Rank is a measure of cosmic power. The <strong>lower</strong> the number, the more
                fundamental and dangerous the being. Rank is both a place in the hierarchy and a power value.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Rank 0</strong> belongs only to <em>the Seven</em>, the universal truths that shape
                time, matter, death, thought, and other constants. They are not gods, they are the rules the
                universe runs on, and cannot be fought or destroyed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Ranks 1–50</strong> cover <strong>planetary titans</strong> and primal forces
                (such as Tala or Khalas). These beings shape continents, climates, and ages. Mortals do not
                defeat them. At best, mortals survive their moods.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Ranks 50–100</strong> are the <strong>greater and lesser gods</strong>, arch spirits,
                and mythic progenitors. They rule realms, pantheons, and great cycles. A whole campaign can
                revolve around resisting or confronting a single being in this band.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Ranks 100–150</strong> are powerful but limited entities: high demigods, ancient
                dragons, fallen celestials, great demons, and world scale monsters. This is where a dedicated
                group of heroes can realistically defeat a “god level” foe if the entire story is built around
                that goal.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Ranks 150–200</strong> mark legendary beings, ascended heroes, regional guardian
                spirits, and unique monsters. Their fall can change kingdoms or eras, but not the structure of
                the world itself.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Below this scale are ordinary mortals and monsters. They do not register as divine, but through
                story, sacrifice, and strange bargains, they can still reach upward and wound the ranks above
                them.

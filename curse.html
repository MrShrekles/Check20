        <h1>What are Curses</h1>
        <h3>Curses as Character Expression and Progression</h3>
        <p>
          Curses are not just penalties. In Check20, they are powerful tools for
          customizing your character and unlocking new options. A curse might
          change how you approach combat, interact with NPCs, or explore the
          world. They introduce a tradeoff: you gain a unique advantage or
          power, but it comes with a cost that alters your gameplay or roleplay.
          Instead of thinking of curses as negative status effects, treat them
          as alternative talents. They are built to deepen your choices, not
          punish them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curses may come from gods, spirits, forbidden tech, or alien realms.
          You might carry a radiant blessing that blinds you to lies, a
          synthetic implant that boosts your reflexes but causes hallucinations,
          or a divine geas that empowers your blade while preventing you from
          fleeing a fight. Some curses evolve with you, growing stronger or
          changing over time.
        </p>
        <h3>Curses as a Form of Progression</h3>
        <p>
          Just like classes, paths, and talents, curses can progress. A curse
          begins with a single quirk or ability, but as you lean into its
          effects, it can develop through additional tiers. This progression can
          unlock powerful boons or alter your playstyle in unexpected ways.
          Curses follow a similar structure to talents: up to 10 steps, each one
          advancing your bond with the force that cursed you. They can be tied
          to specific roleplay events, XP investment, or interactions with the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes curses a third track of character growth alongside path and
          talent progression. You don’t just suffer from a curse. You master it,
          live with it, or reshape it. It becomes part of your story, a
          mechanical and narrative choice that separates you from everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether gifted by angels, hexed by witches, or inherited through
          ancestral blood, a curse is another way to express who your character
          is becoming.

          <h2>Word Burden <small>"Spellcaster’s Curse"</small></h2>
          <p>
            <strong>A Word Burden</strong> is the inevitable toll placed upon
            those who push the boundaries of magic too far. When a Wordspeaker
            draws too deeply from the arcane, their body becomes a living
            script, etched with the radiant glyphs of forgotten tongues. These
            markings hum with latent power, but at great cost; drawing magic
            from a body already inscribed with its weight threatens the caster’s
            mind, stability, and very existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            While a burden at first, those who survive long enough to master
            their affliction can learn to channel its curse into new heights of
            spellcasting. However, the deeper one treads, the harder it becomes
            to turn back.

          <h2>Thorned Demon Curse</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>The Inscription of the Infernal</strong> is an ancient
            curse, wherein the Thorned Demon marks its chosen mortal with
            intricate thorny patterns and diabolical scripts etched into their
            skin. At first, the curse may seem a painful burden, the
            inscriptions pulsating with a burning sensation, the mere sight of
            them enough to instigate unease and fear in others. But with time,
            the bearer can tap into the potent rage dwelling within the curse,

                unsettles those around you.

          <p>
            The allure of combining arcane magic and technological prowess has
            enticed you down a dangerous path. Bit by bit, your body is replaced
            with machinery, your consciousness intertwined with arcane energies
            and electronic impulses. With each step, the boundary between the
            physical and digital, the magical and mechanical, blurs.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Cybernetic Symbiosis:</strong> Your limbs begin to be
                replaced by arcane-imbued technology. Gain advantage on Strength
                or Agility checks relying on the replaced limbs. However, take
                double damage from Lightning damage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Arcane Processor:</strong> A portion of your brain is
                replaced by a magic-tech processor. Gain advantage on Intellect
                and Observation checks, but exposure to powerful magic or
                Lightning damage gives you the confused condition for 1 minute.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Optical Enhancement:</strong> Your eyes are replaced
                with advanced optical sensors. See in dim light as if it were
                bright light and in complete darkness as if it were dim light.
                You can zoom to see far distances. However, flash bangs and
                sudden bright magical lights can blind you for 1 minute.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Aetheric Heart:</strong> Your heart is replaced with a
                magical-tech reactor, removing the need for food and sleep. Gain
                resistance to poison and disease, but you're more susceptible to
                magic drain or anti-magic fields, which cause a random condition
                (2) from the table below for 1 minute.

              <h4>Greater Progression</h4>
              <p>
                As you dive deeper into the mysteries of technomancy, the lines
                blur further. You are neither fully organic nor fully
                mechanical, but something new - an embodiment of magic and
                machine intertwined. Each upgrade strengthens your control over
                technology and magic, granting you unprecedented abilities.
                However, these steps also mark the increasing disconnect between
                your current self and your past humanity, with vulnerabilities
                rooted in your dual nature. Harnessing the full potential of
                this path may lead to unprecedented power or a profound
                existential crisis, and it's up to you to navigate this
                treacherous journey.
              </p>
              <li>
                <strong>Integrated Arcane Arsenal:</strong> Integrate magical
                weapons into your mechanized body parts. These weapons can be

              </li>

                source of damage until the end of your next turn.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Digital Consciousness:</strong> Upload your
                consciousness into digital devices, cybernetics, constructs, or
                anything else with a tech-magic center. If you are more
                powerful, you can overtake or upgrade the device and take
                control.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mananite Restoration:</strong> Mananites circulate

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Singularity Ascension:</strong> Your transformation
                reaches its zenith as you become an entity of pure
                techno-magical energy. Gain the ability to control and shape
                arcane-tech devices in your vicinity, but the stability of your
                new form heavily relies on the availability of arcane and
                technological resources.

        <h1>Diseases</h1>
        <h3>Progression Through Decay</h3>
        <p>
          There are many things that the churches and hospitals have been able
          to contend with even in this modern age of medicine and powerful
          healing. But some afflictions defy conventional cures. Diseases in
          Check20 are not simple conditions. They are living narratives. Like
          curses, they offer progression, but at a terrible cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each disease evolves over time, growing more severe as it spreads
          through the body or soul. Symptoms intensify, abilities degrade, and
          new mutations or behaviors may emerge. While curses can be wielded,
          diseases consume. Most require rare remedies, spiritual intervention,
          or surgical removal if they can be cured at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diseases add urgency, risk, and horrifying depth to the world. Some
          are spread by cursed objects, others by nightmare creatures, and a few
          may be traced to ancient experiments gone wrong. They are stories
          written in flesh, and sometimes the only way to end them is to embrace
          them or burn them out.

            through the rending claws and gnashing teeth of true demons. This
            curse burns away mortal flesh, replacing it with the accursed

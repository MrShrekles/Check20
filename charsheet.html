                        As a Tank, your character embodies the very essence of strength, resilience, and
                        unyielding
                        fortitude. You are the shield that safeguards your allies, the bulwark that stands firm
                        in
                        the
                        face of the enemy onslaught. With every swing of your weapon, you command the
                        battlefield,
                        drawing the attention of foes and absorbing their blows that would otherwise kill your
                        companions and many other creatures as well. Your unmatched stamina and formidable armor
                        make
                        you a veritable living fortress, capable of withstanding onslaughts that would
                        obliterate
                        the
                        less hardy.

                    <p>
                        However, the Tank's might in combat comes with a trade-off. In situations that require
                        finesse,
                        diplomacy, or arcane knowledge, you may find yourself akin to a fish out of water. While
                        your
                        strength and endurance are beyond question, tasks that involve subtlety, stealth, or
                        intricate
                        problem-solving might present a challenge. It's in these moments that you'll need to
                        rely on
                        your allies, just as they depend on your unwavering protection in battle. As a Tank,
                        your
                        role
                        is not to master every situation, but to provide a rock-solid foundation from which your
                        group
                        can confront any danger. Always remember, true strength comes not just from physical
                        power,
                        but
                        from knowing your limits and trusting in your comrades.

                        A shrewd and resourceful individual who knows how to make a profit no matter the
                        circumstances.
                        The Merchant is a master of trade and commerce, always looking for new opportunities to
                        expand
                        their business and increase their wealth. They are not content to simply rely on combat
                        and
                        adventuring to earn a living. Instead, they think beyond these traditional means and use
                        their
                        wits and cunning to get ahead. Whether it's looking for valuable items to sell or
                        stealing
                        from
                        a dragon's hoard to further a political campaign, the Merchant of Adventure is always
                        one
                        step
                        ahead.

                            Merchants can enhance their wealth by investing in businesses, which in turn
                            generate
                            more
                            Merchant Tokens. The initial cost and potential returns of these businesses are set
                            by
                            specific guidelines based on their size. Here are some example businesses:

                            Remember,
                            running a business incurs operating costs. For instance, owning a stable implies
                            expenses
                            for horses, maintenance, etc. Though the system simplifies this aspect, players can
                            further
                            integrate their businesses into gameplay, using them as hubs or even hiring other
                            party

                            <p>
                                For those Merchants embroiled in the underworld, monthly profits are a dance
                                with
                                danger. Every in-game month, perform an Underworld Earnings check to gauge the
                                illicit gains. The outcome can be swayed by the type of operation, its reach,
                                the
                                region's law enforcement vigilance, and unexpected events, such as rival gang
                                confrontations or heists gone wrong.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Choose to roll either a d20 or d100 for this check. Take the result (as a
                                percentage) and multiply it by your venture's potential monthly earnings to
                                deduce
                                your total token haul for the month. But remember, higher rewards often come
                                with
                                greater risks.

                                As a mage, you are a weaver of magic and a master of mysterious forces. Your power is
                                formidable, but it's also unpredictable, and you'll need a creative mind to control it.
                                Unlike
                                other classes, your spellcasting doesn't rely on a pre-set list of spells. Instead, you
                                combine
                                magic words to create your own unique spells. This path is not without its risks and
                                challenges.
                                Your magic can have both positive and negative outcomes, and it's crucial to learn how
                                to
                                manage
                                these ups and downs. One of the crucial aspects of being a mage is the practice of
                                recording
                                and
                                sharing your knowledge. Whether you pass on your wisdom through spellbooks or spiritual
                                knowledge transfer, your experiences and discoveries become a legacy for future
                                characters
                                you
                                play because they all share your soul.

                                    An Excerpt from the Treatise on Arcane Oppositions by Professor Essley Yahir, the
                                    Esteemed Historian of Magic, Magic in all things, and Magical theory, of the Stonetooth
                                    Academy of Magic the Gathering
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “In the vast cosmos of magical energies, the origins of magic types are as diverse as
                                    the stars in the night sky. Each form of magic, while unique in its essence, finds its
                                    place in the grand tapestry of the arcane, often standing in stark opposition to
                                    another. This opposition, far from being a source of conflict, is a testament to the
                                    balance that governs our universe.
                                    Arcane magic, the purest form of magical energy, stands in opposition to the
                                    unpredictable and often destructive Chaos magic. Basic magic, the foundation of all
                                    magical learning, finds its counter in the complex and time-bending Chronomancy which
                                    most regard as the most plot bending of all magics. Celestial magic, drawing its power
                                    from the cosmos and heavenly bodies, is opposed by the ground-bound and ancient Vozian
                                    magic. Dragon magic, a powerful and ancient form tied to the mythical creatures
                                    themselves, is in opposition to Nature magic, which draws its strength from the living
                                    world around us, and as many of us know dragons were the first of the outer planar
                                    beings to come to Shek. Elemental magic, harnessing the raw power of the natural n
                                    elements, stands in contrast to the refined and structured Crystal magic. Life magic,
                                    the nurturing force that promotes growth and healing, finds its counter in the
                                    mechanical and precise Tech magic.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Understanding these oppositions is not merely an academic exercise. It is a journey
                                    towards understanding the fundamental laws that govern our universe and the magical
                                    energies that flow within it. As scholars of the arcane, we must strive to understand
                                    these relationships, not to exploit them, but to respect the delicate balance they
                                    represent and to harness our powers responsibly. Remember, dear students, in the grand
                                    scheme of the cosmos, opposition is not about conflict, but about balance and harmony.”

                                Mana Pools serve as the mage's wellspring of magical energy, a core aspect
                                distinguishing their capabilities and defining their unique connection to the arcane.
                                Unlike talents, which may rely on innate skill or physical prowess, Mana Pools tap
                                directly into the raw essence of magic itself. Each mage draws from their own distinct
                                source of power, shaping the spells they cast and the magic they wield. Below are
                                several Mana Pool options, each offering a different origin for a mage's magical power

                        Over time, "human" has broadened to include other humanoids, yet "true humans" hold a

                                    Historically, Dwarves were integral members of a larger empire that united many
                                    species
                                    groups. However, they broke away following a dispute between their ruler, the
                                    Tyrant
                                    King,
                                    and the Emperor of the empire. This pivotal split shaped Dwarven culture,
                                    fostering
                                    an

                                    around craftsmanship, trade, and a rigid adherence to tradition. Despite their
                                    inclination
                                    toward self-sufficiency, Dwarves are far from isolationist. Their goods and

                                    Elves are a deeply adaptive group of species who evolve and adapt to their

                                    so
                                    thoroughly that they often become integral parts of the ecosystems they inhabit.
                                    Known
                                    for
                                    their grace, long lives, and connection to magic, Elves are a common thread in
                                    the

                                    of many species, having played pivotal roles in the histories of others.

                                    stepped away from their roles as caretakers of other species to focus on

                                    their own identity and purpose. This withdrawal has allowed them to embrace

                                        Gloom Elves have adapted to life in shadowy and subterranean environments,

                                        In the dimly lit caverns deep below the world's surface, the Breaker Elves,
                                        or
                                        Gloom
                                        Elves, have carved a niche alongside the industrious Breaker Dwarves. As the
                                        epochs
                                        passed, these elves have come to share more than just the subterranean
                                        territories
                                        with
                                        the dwarves; they've adopted the Breaker mindset, embracing the intricate
                                        technologies
                                        and complex societal structures of their dwarven neighbors.

                                        Long ago, the ancestors of the Breaker Elves sought refuge in the
                                        underground
                                        realms
                                        to
                                        escape a cataclysmic event on the surface. Over the centuries, their
                                        physiology
                                        adapted
                                        to the darkness, resulting in the evolution of their distinctive dark skin,
                                        which
                                        seamlessly blends with the shadows. Their ethereal hair, reminiscent of
                                        delicate
                                        spider
                                        silk, is a testament to their life away from the sun. The Breaker Elves,
                                        with
                                        their

                                    Gnomes are an inventive and endlessly curious group of species, known for their
                                    boundless
                                    imagination and the risks they often take in pursuit of knowledge. Once thriving
                                    in
                                    the
                                    Feywild, Gnomes were celebrated for their ingenuity and eccentricity. However,
                                    their
                                    curiosity took a dark turn with the rise of the Tinker Gnomes, who, in their
                                    pursuit
                                    of
                                    magical power, began harvesting dryad hearts to create cores for powerful
                                    constructs.

                                    When the atrocities came to light, the Feywild itself, under the guidance of
                                    Mother
                                    Nature,
                                    banished all Gnomes, marking them as exiles. Though the actions of the Tinker

                                    their
                                    home plane forever. This banishment left a deep mark on Gnomish culture,
                                    splitting

                                    Despite their complicated past, Gnomes are fiercely determined to make their
                                    mark on
                                    the

                                    intricate machinery, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. While many

                                    resent the mistakes of their ancestors, others see their exile as a challenge to
                                    prove
                                    that
                                    their ingenuity can benefit the world without repeating the sins of the past.

                                    Physically, Kleinkind are marvels of density. Standing no taller than 2 feet,

                                    unexpectedly
                                    sturdy. A 1-foot Kleinkind can weigh up to 60 pounds, leading to many a startled

                                    who underestimated their strength. Despite their heft, they move with surprising

                                    like a stone rolling downhill—steady and unstoppable.

                                <p>
                                    The Ensuri are a mystical and enigmatic species, born from the union of humans and
                                    the primordial forces of the elements.
                                    Tracing their lineage back to the dawn of existence, the Ensuri embody the fierce
                                    power and untamed beauty of the natural world.
                                    Some among them hail from ancient families, their bloodlines intertwined with
                                    elemental spirits through sacred rites and ancient pacts.
                                    Others are the product of transformation, individuals who were altered by profound
                                    elemental events, forever changed by their exposure to raw elemental power.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With appearances as diverse as the elements themselves, the Ensuri possess traits
                                    reflective of their elemental heritage—skin that shimmers like the surface
                                    of a lake under moonlight for those of water lineage, or eyes that flicker with the
                                    undying flame of their fire ancestors. They are beings of both creation
                                    and destruction, capable of wielding their elemental powers with a natural ease that
                                    belies their human origins.

                                            tribes are known for their storytelling and vibrant festivals. They prefer

                                            refreshing, such as ceviche and sushi, mirroring the coastal cuisine and

                                <h3>Helborn</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Born from the merging of demonic energy and mortal essence, Helborn are beings of
                                    profound power and mystique.
                                    Each Options reflects the distinctive traits of the nine layers of Ordealis,
                                    making them as diverse as they are formidable.
                                    Their appearance varies from the metallic hues of the Iron Dominion to the eerie
                                    glow of the Clockwork Abyss, symbolizing their otherworldly origins.
                                    Helborn possess abilities that echo the realms they are connected to, from
                                    manipulating memories and time to mastering the elements of ice and sound.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Despite being feared and often shunned by other species for their infernal heritage,
                                    many Helborn strive to transcend their ominous nature,
                                    proving that they can be as noble or malevolent as their choices dictate. Their
                                    society is complex, often shaped by the harsh realities of their birthright,
                                    yet enriched by a deep sense of kinship and survival.

                                            abyss. Often viewed as loners, they can
                                            also be part of a tight-knit community. They are very protective of their
                                            own kind and will fiercely defend them if threatened. Some are quite wise
                                            and knowledgeable, possessing ancient
                                            secrets not shared with outsiders. They have a strong sense of pride and
                                            honor, with unwavering loyalty to their own.

                                <h3>Seraphim</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In the vast tapestry of existence, few beings hold as revered a position as the
                                    Seraphim. These celestial entities stand as shining paragons of devotion,
                                    embodying the zenith of spiritual commitment. To become a Seraphim is not merely an
                                    elevation in form but a testament to the unyielding faith and dedication
                                    one holds to their chosen deity or creed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many Seraphim were once mortals, fervent clerics and paladins who, through their
                                    unwavering service, found themselves transformed, touched by the divine essence
                                    of their deity. These chosen ones shed their mortal coil, ascending to a state of
                                    celestial grace, their very being infused with holy energy. Their previous lives
                                    as guardians of faith on the material plane set the foundation for their new
                                    existence as divine emissaries, bridging the gap between the heavens and the earthly
                                    realms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yet, not all Seraphim are born from acts of devout mortals. Ancient lineages of
                                    these celestial beings have existed since the dawn of time, chronicled in age-old
                                    scriptures and cosmic legends. These primordial Seraphim are believed to be the
                                    first of their kind, created by the gods themselves to serve as their most trusted
                                    advisors and guardians.

                                            The Dreamborn are a species of humanoid creatures born from the realm of
                                            dreams, the Dreamsea. They possess an ethereal and otherworldly presence,
                                            and are known for their fun-loving and joyful nature. Their mere presence
                                            has a way of bringing out the best in others, spreading positivity and joy

                                            They possess a unique ability to tap into the subconscious minds of those
                                            around them, interpreting and manifesting their deepest desires and fondest

                                            They can be familiar yet elusive, as if they are constantly drifting in and
                                            out of reality. They are a peaceful and harmonious species, who value

                                            They are often seen as the embodiment of hope and inspiration, and are
                                            greatly respected and admired by those who are lucky enough to encounter
                                            them.

                    <h3>Goblijjins</h3>
                    <p>
                        Deep within the annals of history, the Goblijjins emerged from the very essence of VoZo,
                        the Primordial Evil that once threatened to consume Shek.
                        Born of chaos and malevolence, their early ancestors were feared, loathed, and branded
                        as the living symbols of evil's persistence in the world.
                        Yet, time has a way of reshaping destinies, and the Goblijjins of today are a testament
                        to that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the sprawling grasslands to the hidden alleyways of cities, Goblijjins have found
                        their place. While the shadow of their sinister lineage does loom
                        over them, the Goblijjins have strived hard to redefine themselves. But society, often
                        harsh and unforgiving, has rarely been welcoming. To most, Goblijjins are
                        still the remnants of an era best forgotten, and they face the brunt of that prejudice.
                        With the deck stacked against them, many Goblijjins embrace roles that benefit
                        the greater good, hoping to find a measure of acceptance. Yet, the world remains wary,
                        keeping them at arm's length.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In their heart of hearts, every Goblijjin struggles with their innate mischievous
                        nature. Whether it's a sly prank, a cheeky comment, or simply being a "little stinker,"
                        it's hardwired into their very being. It's not just a choice; it's a part of who they
                        are, a reminder of their tumultuous origin. This playful, sometimes disruptive,
                        behavior often gets them into trouble, further alienating them from other species. Their
                        names, often odd and humorous like "Snotbubble" or "Wiggletoe," are a reflection
                        of their unique culture and perspective on life. For a species with such a fleeting
                        lifespan, every moment is a celebration, every day a dance. There's a saying among
                        Goblijjins:
                        "Live for the giggle, for tomorrow we might not be here to hear it." And live they do,
                        with a fervor and zest that few can match.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the most distinct characteristics of the Goblijjins is their black, flaky blood.
                        When exposed to the air, it crystallizes and turns to ash, drifting away with the wind.
                        A poignant metaphor for their transient lives, perhaps. Despite the challenges they
                        face, the Goblijjins are a testament to resilience, adaptability, and the indomitable
                        spirit
                        to rise above one's origins. While the world may not always be kind to them, the
                        Goblijjins of Shek continue to carve out their place, one mischievous giggle at a time.

                                    throughout the world is a testament to their adaptability and resilience.
                                    From the sprawling grasslands to the deepest, forgotten dungeons, one can find
                                    traces of these tenacious beings. Their language, a unique dialect known as
                                    "Gutter Common," stands as a symbol of their distinct identity, even if it's often

                                            In the vast stretches of Shek's untamed wilderness, the Wild Goblins thrive.
                                            These little rascals, often named with playful and bizarre monikers
                                            like "Gigglemud" or "Plopfoot", live in transient communities that rise and
                                            fall with the seasons. Their lives are a blend of mischief and survival,
                                            as they harness their innate cunning to navigate the challenges of the wild.
                                            Wild Goblins are known for their unyielding spirit and an uncanny ability
                                            to adapt quickly to their surroundings, making them elusive adversaries and
                                            curious allies.

                                            The bustling streets of Shek's cities are home to a different breed of
                                            goblins - the City Goblins. They have traded the vast open wilderness for

                                            labyrinths of urban life. Dressed in whatever finery they can acquire, often
                                            with an eccentric flair, these goblins are savvy traders, skilled artisans,
                                            and street-smart entrepreneurs.
                                            Their names often reflect their trades or peculiar habits, leading to
                                            goblins called "Silkthread" or "Dingledangle". Even in the cities, their

                                            but it's tempered with a keen sense of business acumen.

                                    Hojgoblins, often considered the matured cousins of goblins, are a testament to
                                    evolution or perhaps a stroke of magical chance.
                                    Some say they were born of goblins who consumed enchanted fruits, while others argue
                                    they were deliberately shaped by arcane forces.
                                    Whatever the case, Hojgoblins have carved a niche for themselves as strategic
                                    masterminds and refined engineers. Their reputation precedes them;
                                    many war generals eagerly seek their counsel in battles, while cities benefit from
                                    their architectural prowess. Yet, with heightened intelligence comes a darker side.
                                    Some Hojgoblins find themselves on a perilous edge, where overthinking can spiral
                                    into madness. This duality of genius and potential instability makes them a complex
                                    and fascinating race in the world of Shek.

                                            ancient lineage that despises arcane forces. Their very presence is a bane

                    <h3>Giants</h3>
                    <p>
                        Giants, once formidable beings of incomprehensible might and stature, have become
                        entities shrouded in enigma and dark tales.
                        Thousands of years prior, their kind, the True Giants, were expelled or driven from the
                        prime material plane through a tumult of cosmic-scale events and ethereal politics
                        that were far beyond their control or comprehension. Yet, the ripple of their ancient
                        presence still lingers hauntingly across the lands, and their descendants, although
                        diminished,
                        tread cautiously in a world that has grown wary of their lineage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The True Giants, beings of incredible power and stature, were banished to the distant
                        realms by the celestial powers, forever locked away from the prime material plane due to
                        a cascade
                        of cataclysmic occurrences and divine interventions. Their banishment, wrought with
                        sorrow and wrath, echoed through the cosmos, leaving a scar in the collective memory of
                        all beings in Shek.
                        Even now, these giants, known as the "Banished", linger in their distant, secluded
                        realms, their hearts heavy with the burden of lost epochs and a deep yearning for the
                        world they were torn away from.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the contemporary epoch of Shek, those of giant lineage walk a precarious path,
                        ever-shadowed by the colossal specters of their ancestors. Three distinct species of
                        half-giants, each bearing
                        the diluted yet still formidable blood of their forebears, inhabit the world, each
                        uniquely adapted to their struggle for acceptance and survival amidst a populace that
                        regards them with a mixture
                        of awe and trepidation.

                                    In realms unknown, the Nirvāsita wander, echoes of a once-majestic past now shrouded
                                    in the mists of exile. Their eyes, dull yet harboring flickers of ancient
                                    tales and struggles, gaze upon alien horizons, a silent testament to their
                                    banishment from the prime material plane. Immortal yet drained, their large forms

                                    through the abyss, resilient against the trials of their imposed purgatory. In their

                                    amidst the unknown, perhaps to one day breach the veil between planes, and return to
                                    a home long lost.

                    <div class="two-column">
                        <div class="column">
                            <p>
                                In the epoch before recorded time, Shek was a tempestuous realm, constantly wracked by
                                the chaotic fury of the elements. This world, brimming with raw elemental potential,
                                was a cacophony of roaring thunder, raging infernos, surging tides, and howling gales.
                                It was during this tumultuous age that the God Dragon Khalas descended upon Shek,
                                drawn by the planet's untamed energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Khalas, a colossal being of indescribable magnificence, bore scales that shimmered with
                                the luminescence of a thousand stars. With wings vast enough to blanket entire
                                cities and eyes that held the wisdom of the cosmos, Khalas was a deity of unparalleled
                                power. As the mighty dragon landed, the storms themselves seemed to bow before
                                this majestic entity, waiting in bated anticipation. Drawing upon an ancient and arcane
                                rite, Khalas inhaled deeply, absorbing the wild elemental tempests that raged
                                across Shek. Every bolt of lightning, every lick of flame, every gust of wind, and every
                                crashing wave was drawn into the God Dragon's maw. The very fabric of the world
                                held its breath, and for a brief moment, an eerie calm descended upon Shek.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then, with an exhalation that resonated with the force of creation itself, Khalas
                                birthed the Crumbling Void. This vast expanse, a space where the elements met
                                and melded, became a canvas upon which new life would be painted. With each subsequent
                                breath, Khalas infused the void with fragments of the elements, giving birth
                                to the myriad species of dragons that would come to populate Shek.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From the fiery breath of Khalas came the Crimson Pyre Dragons, embodiments of flame and
                                fury. The cool exhalations birthed the Glacial Shard Dragons, masters of frost
                                and ice. The gentle sighs brought forth the Cloudburst Dragons, rulers of the skies and
                                storms. And so, with each breath, a new lineage of dragons was formed, each inheriting
                                a fragment of Khalas's elemental might.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="column">
                            <p>
                                In the ages that followed, these dragons would go on to shape the history and destiny of
                                Shek. They carved out territories, established dynasties, and played pivotal roles
                                in the world's evolving narrative. Yet, they never forgot their divine origins, always
                                paying homage to Khalas, the God Dragon who breathed life into their kind.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though Khalas's physical presence has long since faded from Shek, the legacy of that
                                fateful day remains. The dragons, in all their elemental splendor, are a testament
                                to the God Dragon's creative force. They are not just creatures of myth and legend, but
                                living embodiments of Shek's primal history, forever soaring through its skies,
                                guarding its secrets, and shaping its future.

                                            allow them to blend into the shadows. Despite their solitary nature, they're
                                            known to assist travelers in need, guiding them safely away from wildfires
                                            with their smoke breath.

                                            They bear an aloof attitude and often exhibit a sense of superiority over

                                            Reaver Dragons are the largest of all these dragon types, their massive
                                            bodies
                                            covered in metallic scales that gleam in the sunlight.
                                            They have large, curved horns and a thick, bladed tail that's as deadly as

                                            a noble spirit and often intervene to maintain harmony in their territory.

                                            The largest of all dragons, the Crystal Wyrms are magnificent creatures with

                                            that resemble an array of gemstones, not limited to emeralds
                                            but including sapphires, rubies, and diamonds. These scales glint and

                                            with
                                            an ethereal light, casting colorful reflections. Their horns are
                                            like crystallized sculptures, and their tails are thick and blunted, used as

                                            powerful weapon. Crystal formations adorn their bodies, adding to their

                                            align themselves with the forces of balance and nature.

                            and your eyes hold a spark of innocence and curiosity. Despite being quite small,

                            that few can resist. You are an enigma, your lineage unknown, your future uncertain.
                            Whether you're a descendant of a mighty Elemental, a
                            mystical Planar, the tenacious Neutral, the revered Metallic, or even the majestic
                            Gem dragons, only time will reveal.

                                    existence is a riddle, a phenomenon that baffles many, born from the
                                    improbable union of the mundane and the mythical.
                                    You bear features of both lineages—scales glinting like armor, eyes glowing
                                    with ancient wisdom, and a humanoid form that stands tall and proud. Your
                                    voice carries an echo of draconic roars,
                                    and your breath hints at the elemental power inherited from your draconic

                                    dragon lineage, and dragons are skeptical of your human side. But the
                                    potential within you is undeniable.
                                    How you wield this power, whether for good or ill, is your choice. Prove to
                                    the world that being a "bad dragon" means being extraordinarily formidable,
                                    not feared.

                    <p>
                        The Greenborn are a diverse collective of plant and fungal species, embodying the
                        vibrant, untamed spirit of nature itself. Rooted in the ancient magic of the natural
                        world, they serve as protectors, nurturers, and guardians of the verdant realms. Whether
                        thriving in shadowy forests, sunlit groves, or misty marshlands, the Greenborn are
                        intrinsically tied to the life force of the land they inhabit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each Greenborn carries a fragment of the world’s primal vitality, their existence a
                        living testament to the endless cycles of growth, decay, and renewal. From the towering,
                        immovable Husk Otaota to the enigmatic, spore-filled Ciuperca, they are as varied as the
                        ecosystems they call home. These beings are not merely part of nature—they are nature,
                        walking and breathing embodiments of the earth’s will.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the Greenborn are often misunderstood or feared by other species, their wisdom
                        and connection to the land make them vital to maintaining the delicate balance of Shek’s
                        ecosystems. Through songs whispered on the wind, spores drifting through the air, or the
                        silent communion of roots beneath the soil, the Greenborn share a collective
                        consciousness that transcends words. They revere the ancient spirits of nature, honoring
                        their duty to protect the sacred groves, ancient forests, and untamed wilds that give
                        them life.

                                    Resembling a cross between human and tree, the Otaota’s bodies are adorned with
                                    leaves,
                                    glowing flowers, and sturdy

                                    these natural spirits. Their songs, dances, and carvings are sacred acts, used to

                                    Otaota villages are often hidden within vast, ancient forests or atop lush volcanic
                                    islands. These settlements are built
                                    in harmony with the environment, featuring homes carved into living trees, gardens
                                    tended by their plant allies, and
                                    totems adorned with intricate leaf patterns and glowing sap. Otaota celebrations are
                                    vibrant and full of life, with
                                    festivals honoring the bloom cycles, harvests, and celestial events that guide their

                                        The Thorn Otaota are the vigilant defenders of their kind, embodying the

                                        elements. Their bodies are bristling with sharp thorns, a natural armor and

                                        resolve. Thorns are often found along the outer borders of Otaota territories,

                                        even the harshest conditions to protect their kin.

                                        tending to resilient and hardy plants that thrive in difficult environments.
                                        Many Thorn Otaota paint their bark

                                    The Venin Otaota are enigmatic and feared, their very essence infused with toxic sap
                                    that flows like venom through their veins.
                                    Venin are the unseen protectors of the Otaota, often acting from the shadows to
                                    safeguard their people. Their sap, while deadly to foes,
                                    is sacred to their kind, symbolizing both the power of life and the inevitability of
                                    decay.

                                    They act as guardians of these sacred spaces, where their poisonous nature is most
                                    effective. Their ability to commune with and command
                                    other plant life is revered within Otaota culture, as they can summon dense thickets
                                    or
                                    poisonous vines to entrap enemies or bolster defenses.

                                    In the deep, dark forests of the realm, a strange and ancient species of mushroom
                                    has
                                    come to prominence.
                                    These sentient beings, known as the Fungi, have evolved over millennia to possess
                                    intelligence and will of their own.
                                    They are capable of communicating with one another through a complex system of
                                    spores
                                    and chemicals, and possess a
                                    deep understanding of the natural world around them. Some Fungi have even learned to
                                    harness the power of magic,
                                    using their unique physiology to cast powerful spells and curses. Though they are
                                    often
                                    feared and misunderstood by
                                    the other races of the realm, the Fungi are a vital part of the ecosystem, and play
                                    a
                                    crucial role in maintaining the
                                    balance of nature.

                                    Fungi come in many variations, from the small, psychedelic mushrooms that are used
                                    by
                                    the local tribes for religious rituals,

                                    to wander too close. Each species
                                    of Fungi has its own unique abilities and characteristics, making them a fascinating

                                    This species of mushroom is highly toxic and can cause severe illness or death if
                                    consumed. They typically have a dark cap,
                                    often with a glossy or slimy texture. They are often found in wooded areas and can
                                    be
                                    mistaken for edible mushrooms by foragers.

                                    They are often found in graveyards or other spooky areas and are often associated

                    <h3>Symbiotes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Symbiotes are an enigmatic and ancient species known for their unique ability to form
                        powerful bonds with various hosts.
                        They can be found in the darkest corners and most sacred spaces of the world, attracted
                        to beings with strong capabilities
                        and unique traits. They enhance their host's abilities while deriving sustenance and
                        other benefits from the bond. These
                        extraordinary creatures exist in various forms, such as the aggressive Parasitic
                        Symbiotes and the wise Eternal Worms.
                        Each symbiote offers a distinct set of skills and enhancements, making them highly
                        sought-after companions for those who
                        can handle the challenges and responsibilities of hosting such powerful beings. Their
                        bonds with their hosts create a
                        profound and life-changing connection, forever altering the destinies of both parties
                        involved.

                        <h4>Symbiote Removal</h4>
                        <p>
                            Removing a symbiote is a dangerous and delicate process. A successful Medicine check
                            is
                            required to safely remove the symbiote
                            without causing harm to the host or the symbiote. If the check fails, the host and
                            symbiote each take damage and may suffer
                            from various conditions or penalties.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Being Without a Host</h4>
                        <p>
                            Symbiotes can survive outside of a host for a number of hours equal to their
                            Survival
                            check. If they do not find a willing or
                            otherwise suitable host within that time, they immediately take the Death condition.

                                            To bond, the symbiote must succeed on an Influence Check to convince
                                            the host of the mutual benefits of
                                            their relationship. Once bonded, the symbiote grants the host the

                                        <li><strong>Devourer:</strong> A host bonded through Devourer lasts for
                                            one month or until the host dies.
                                            To bond, the symbiote must win a contested Strength Check to
                                            forcibly overtake the host's body. On a failure,
                                            the host is immune to the Devourer while alive. Once bonded, the
                                            symbiote enhances the host’s combat
                                            capabilities, granting +1 to melee attack checks and damage.
                                            Additionally, the host gains the ability to heal
                                            themselves as an action for [[6 Healing]] or remove one Corpus

                                            indefinitely, as the symbiote thrives
                                            in secrecy without overtly harming the host. To bond, the symbiote
                                            must succeed on a Stealth Check to
                                            infiltrate the host’s body without their knowledge. Once bonded, the
                                            Passenger can, as an action, grant the
                                            host Invisibility until the end of their next turn or until they

                                Firstborn resemble dark-skinned elves with a few distinct features. They have
                                tendrils in place of hair and insect-like
                                wing appendages. Their skin tones range from deep, earthy shades to darker hues

                                sheen under direct light, reflecting their resilient nature and powerful gifts.
                                Firstborn can use their tendrils for
                                various tasks, offering them unique interaction possibilities with the

                                    In the spectral hierarchy of strigoi, the Tristeţe are the outcasts, the forsaken.
                                    Their name, translating to 'sadness',
                                    poignantly mirrors their existence. These unfortunate vampires, transformed into
                                    lesser beings by disease, foul magic, or
                                    tragic incidents, bear grotesque deformities. Their skin, weak and light-sensitive,
                                    compels them to lurk in the shadows, away
                                    from the sun's harsh judgment and society's scorn. Immortal, their existence is an
                                    endless nocturnal cycle.

                                    illusion. Despite their tragic circumstances, they outnumber their nobler
                                    counterparts, their prevalence a harsh testament
                                    to the vampire world's realities. Their deformed bodies, grotesquely resilient, can

                                    harmful, their unholy nature rendering them
                                    vulnerable to such forces.

                                    The Tristeţe embody the vampire legend's darker side, a stark contrast to the
                                    nobility and allure often associated with
                                    their kind. They are the forsaken, the deformed, the sorrowful, their existence a

                                    possibilities lurking in the vampire world's shadows.

                                    In the shadowy realm of the undead, the Avuţie stand as the epitome of vampire
                                    nobility. They are the embodiment of the timeless
                                    allure and chilling dread that has become synonymous with the vampire legend. The
                                    Avuţie are not mere predators of the night,
                                    but sophisticated rulers who have held the reins of power for centuries. They have
                                    been kings and queens, lords and ladies,
                                    their rule extending over vast lands shrouded in fear and mystery. Their wealth is
                                    as ancient as they are, accrued over
                                    countless lifetimes, a testament to their cunning and influence. Despite their
                                    elegance and charm, the Avuţie are a chilling
                                    reminder of the true nature of the strigoi. They are as dangerous as they are
                                    alluring, their wealth and influence making
                                    them a formidable force in the world of the undead.

                                    The Tărie, the embodiment of raw, unyielding strength, are a formidable sight to
                                    behold. These Dravin-kin are the epitome of
                                    physical prowess among the strigoi, their bodies honed to perfection through
                                    centuries of relentless training and battle. Their
                                    skin, ashen and cold, is a stark contrast to the vibrant crimson of the blood that
                                    sustains them. Their eyes, a piercing silver,
                                    radiate an intimidating presence, a clear warning to any who dare to cross their
                                    path.

                                    Their wings, massive and powerful, are not just for show. They are fully functional,
                                    capable of carrying the Tărie into the sky.
                                    But these wings serve another purpose. They are strong and dexterous enough to wield
                                    additional simple melee weapons, turning the
                                    Tărie into a whirlwind of steel and fury on the battlefield. This unique ability
                                    allows them to engage multiple enemies at once.

                                    Their eyes glow with an eerie light, a beacon in the darkness they navigate so well.
                                    They move with purpose and intent, their
                                    actions driven by inscrutable goals known only to them and their undying deities.

                            Zoanthropes, also known as shifters or half-men, are a unique species of creatures
                            that possess both human
                            and animal traits. They are neither wholly human nor wholly animal, placing them
                            outside of society's norms
                            and conventions. They have the ability to shift between human and animal forms, a
                            skill that sets them apart
                            and makes them both fascinating and feared. Known for their strong connections to
                            the natural world, they
                            possess heightened senses, strength, and agility. While revered by some cultures as
                            protectors of the natural
                            world, they are often ostracized and discriminated against, seen as freaks and
                            outsiders. They frequently form
                            tight-knit communities where they can find acceptance among their own kind.

                                        These shifters possess a strong predatory heritage and are characterized by
                                        their sharp claws and powerful jaws.
                                        They are skilled hunters, often preying on meat to sustain themselves. Rarely
                                        found in cities, they prefer a tribal
                                        lifestyle where they can hunt and roam freely. Fierce and powerful, they are
                                        often seen as protectors of their tribe.

                                        These half-men have evolved to possess avian characteristics, with the ability
                                        to shift into a full bird form. Agile
                                        and quick, they can fly and soar with the grace of a bird. Often found near
                                        communities of avian beastfolk, they are
                                        considered a mutation of the humanoid/lycanthrope. Known for their strong sense
                                        of community, they are highly
                                        intelligent and adaptable.

                                        These shifters possess a strong aquatic heritage, characterized by their ability
                                        to shift into a full aquatic form
                                        such as fish or marine mammals. Equipped with powerful fins, gills, and webbed
                                        extremities, they excel in
                                        underwater environments. With heightened senses underwater and the ability to
                                        communicate with aquatic
                                        creatures, they are considered protectors of the ocean and its inhabitants.
                                        Often found near coastal or aquatic
                                        communities, they are known for their peaceful and loyal nature.

                                    <p>
                                        The Satyrs are a mystical and mischievous breed of shifters, deeply tied to the
                                        feywild and the untamed forces
                                        of nature. Often mistaken for beastmen, Satyrs possess a unique blend of
                                        humanoid intelligence and feral
                                        instinct. With goat-like features such as cloven hooves, small horns, and nimble
                                        frames, their true essence lies
                                        in their connection to the fey.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Natural performers and instigators, Satyrs thrive in chaos and revelry, wielding
                                        haunting melodies and
                                        captivating charm to influence others. Despite their playful demeanor, they are
                                        fiercely protective of their kin
                                        and the wilds they call home. Often found in ancient groves or hidden fey
                                        crossings, they act as guardians and
                                        emissaries of their enigmatic fey ancestry.

                                        determination of their humanoid form. Known as tireless hunters and warriors,
                                        they roam the expansive
                                        grasslands and plains they call home. Centaur society revolves around freedom
                                        and duty, with members acting
                                        as both protectors and providers for their community.

                                        In a bitter conflict with the Hellborn Minotaurs over the Thundering Plains,
                                        Centaurs view this battle as a fight
                                        for the survival of their way of life. Agile and fast, they are unmatched in

                                        revered as guardians of the plains. Skilled artisans and storytellers, Centaurs
                                        preserve their rich history
                                        through oral tradition and symbolic art, drawing strength from their connection

                            multiple origins. Most Araknakin hail
                            from the Red Desert, a homeland for insect-like species that have adapted to its
                            harsh conditions. Among these
                            unique creatures are the Scorpikin.

                                    Scorpikin, also known as Aqrabuamelu in their native tongue, are fierce
                                    and formidable shifters. Created
                                    by the dragon goddess Tiamat to wage war against her rivals, these
                                    half-human, half-scorpion beings have
                                    since gained independence. Now residing in the Red Desert, they live
                                    under the rule of the powerful
                                    insect-like Scarab Lords. With their human upper body and scorpion lower
                                    half, Scorpikin possess immense
                                    strength, agility, and an additional pair of pincers that can hold
                                    objects or be used as weapons. Known
                                    for their fierce loyalty and combat prowess, Scorpikin are a force to be
                                    reckoned with on the battlefield.

                                Spiderkin are a unique species of humanoids characterized by their lean,
                                thickly haired bodies and large
                                mandibles. Their mandibles make speaking the common tongue difficult, yet
                                they have adapted to communicate
                                effectively. Females of the species are known for their powerful builds and
                                combat abilities, while males
                                are agile and often skilled in magic. Fiercely loyal to their tribes, they
                                are commonly found in wooded or
                                mountainous regions where they spin webs for hunting and protection. Many
                                Spiderkin have found work in
                                libraries, weaving intricate web systems to categorize and organize
                                knowledge.

                                Tikkin are a small, elusive species known for their need to survive on
                                blood. With small statures and sharp fangs,
                                they feed on the blood of other creatures. Despite their unique dietary
                                requirements, Tikkin are not inherently
                                violent, often finding non-harmful methods to sustain themselves. However,
                                their nature leads to societal rejection,
                                forcing them to live in the shadows. Fiercely protective of their
                                communities, Tikkin have developed a strong sense
                                of loyalty and care for their own kind. Some have learned to control their
                                blood thirst, while others struggle to
                                overcome their instincts.

                            Avians are a diverse species of beastmen whose feathered forms and flight abilities
                            connect them to the skies.
                            Adapted to various climates and cultures across the world, they range from proud
                            hawk-like warriors to peaceful
                            dove-like diplomats, each embodying unique avian traits. Their cities, suspended
                            among the clouds or perched atop
                            towering peaks, are marvels of architecture, blending natural beauty with
                            engineering precision. These skybound
                            civilizations are steeped in ancient feathered traditions, including the sacred
                            "Molting Ceremony," where feathers
                            lost in combat or hardship are ritually honored as symbols of resilience.

                            Avians are natural navigators, known for their ability to traverse great distances
                            with ease, making them revered
                            messengers and scouts. While fiercely protective of their aerial territories, Avians
                            often serve as bridges between
                            grounded civilizations, bringing knowledge, trade, and diplomacy from one land to
                            another. Their language, Naech
                            (or Trill), is a melodic combination of chirps, whistles, and harmonics that echoes
                            their heritage. As guardians of
                            the skies and keepers of the winds, Avians hold their ancient traditions as dearly
                            as they do their freedom, soaring
                            through history as symbols of unity and wisdom.

                                        Corvus are a unique avian subspecies born under the patronage of the gods Huginn
                                        and Muninn. Those born under
                                        Huginn are intelligent crows, while those under Muninn are ravens cursed by a

                                        though they can only speak in mimicry if they choose to. This duality of
                                        intelligence and memory has led them to
                                        thrive in roles as court reporters, spies, and stage performers. Often found in
                                        cities, Corvus use their talents
                                        to gather information, navigate social hierarchies, and make a living. Skilled
                                        in stealth and adept at moving in

                                    <p>
                                        Penguins are a unique subspecies of avian beastmen, adapted to life in cold
                                        coastal regions and the open ocean.
                                        Though flightless, they are exceptional swimmers and agile divers, capable of
                                        navigating icy waters with unmatched
                                        grace. Known for their tightly-knit communities, they build intricate ice
                                        villages along glacial coasts, fortified
                                        against the harsh elements. Penguins hold deep cultural reverence for the
                                        "Eternal Ice," an ancient tradition
                                        celebrating resilience, teamwork, and the bond between the sea and the sky.
                                        These ceremonies involve synchronized
                                        dances and storytelling by elder penguins, recounting legendary migrations and
                                        ocean spirits.

                                        Penguins have strong protective instincts, working cooperatively to guard their
                                        homes from predators and environmental
                                        dangers. Their natural resilience and physical adaptations make them excellent

                                        invaluable allies in both the sea and icy terrains. Despite their smaller
                                        stature and inability to fly, penguins
                                        exemplify determination, resourcefulness, and a profound connection to the
                                        ocean's mysteries.

                                        rise from their ashes, they are symbols of hope and perseverance. Phoenix
                                        societies focus on the cycles of life, death,
                                        and rebirth, with sacred pyres serving as places of renewal and meditation.
                                        Their fiery presence and ability to endure
                                        make them a beacon of resilience and inspiration.

                        <h3>Beruklians</h3>
                        <p>
                            Beruklians are a unique and advanced species of ape humanoids that originated from
                            various tropical islands around
                            the world. They have unified on the island of Beruklian, where they have developed a
                            highly organized and hierarchical
                            society. Due to the island's dense population, towering high-rise structures have
                            been constructed to house their
                            vibrant culture. The city is a bustling hub of trade, commerce, and education, with
                            a deep respect for hierarchy and
                            order reflected in every aspect of their society. Even when Beruklians leave the
                            island, they maintain their strong
                            sense of social hierarchy and order, making them a fascinating species to observe.

                                        They are often feared for their aggressive and unpredictable behavior. With

                            and Foxxin subspecies. They are characterized by physical traits resembling canines,
                            such as sharp teeth, strong
                            jaws, and powerful paws. Known for their strength, intelligence, and diverse
                            abilities, Caniforms are a valued and
                            respected part of any society.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Lupine (Alpha) subspecies are proud and noble leaders, known for their fierce
                            loyalty and exceptional hunting
                            skills. The Lupine (Sovereign) subspecies are regal and majestic, often serving as
                            mediators and diplomats due to
                            their intelligence and strong sense of justice. The Ursakin subspecies are large and
                            sturdy, known for their strength,
                            endurance, and love of nature, despite their intimidating appearance. The Foxxin
                            subspecies are mischievous and
                            cunning, known for their adaptability, quick wit, and charming personalities.
                            Together, these subspecies reflect the

                                        The Lupine (Alpha) subspecies are proud, fiercely loyal leaders, easily
                                        recognized by their striking coats of pure
                                        white or jet black—a mark of their lineage, said to descend from Fenris
                                        themself. Their heritage ties them to
                                        ancient tales of bravery and ferocity, with some Alphas claiming to carry
                                        Fenris’s wild spirit within them. Alphas
                                        are natural-born leaders, often serving as pack heads, tribal chiefs, or war
                                        commanders. While their hot-headed
                                        nature can lead to brash decisions, their determination and unwavering loyalty
                                        inspire those who follow them.

                                    <p>
                                        In the wild, Alphas are exceptional hunters, using their keen senses to track
                                        prey and enemies alike. Their booming
                                        howls, resonant and commanding, rally their allies and strike fear into foes.
                                        Despite their impulsive tendencies,
                                        Alphas hold a deep responsibility for their pack’s well-being, often putting
                                        themselves at risk to protect their
                                        kin. They embody both the strength and flaws of their legendary ancestor.

                                        The nomadic Coyotes are the wandering storytellers and resilient survivalists of
                                        the Caniform species. Often traveling
                                        in small groups or as lone adventurers, they are known for their sharp tongues
                                        and clever antics. Coyotes thrive in open
                                        plains, deserts, and scrublands, where they use their humor and guile to outwit
                                        enemies and navigate social conflicts.

                                        Believing in the power of stories to inspire and unite, Coyotes often serve as
                                        the historians of their people. Their
                                        ability to adapt to harsh conditions makes them skilled scavengers and cunning
                                        strategists. While their antics can be
                                        chaotic, they are also deeply tied to their trickster roots, bringing laughter

                            The Cloven are a proud and reclusive species of humanoid beastmen, characterized by
                            their cloven hooves and shaggy
                            fur. Native to mountainous regions, they live in small, tight-knit communities.
                            Despite their gruff exterior, Cloven
                            are fiercely loyal to their families and will go to great lengths to protect them.
                            They are excellent hunters and
                            trackers, relying on their keen senses and agility to survive in harsh environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In combat, Cloven utilize their powerful legs and sharp hooves to devastating
                            effect, often charging into battle with
                            reckless abandon. While generally wary of outsiders, they can be formidable allies

                                        balance are unparalleled. Known for their bold nature and fierce independence,
                                        they are often found in mountainous
                                        regions, grazing on natural grasses and defending their tight-knit communities
                                        with vigor. Despite their aloof demeanor,
                                        Caprakin hold strong loyalty to their herds and ancestral lands.

                                        Legends of the Caprakin tell of their defiance against invaders, using their
                                        mountainous homes as natural fortresses to
                                        repel stronger foes. Their haunting war cries echo through the cliffs,
                                        instilling fear and awe in those who hear them.
                                        Caprakin culture values resilience, storytelling, and a deep connection to the

                                        The Labyrinthine Minotaurs are ancient guardians, revered for their unparalleled
                                        sense of direction and role as
                                        protectors of sacred mazes. Their fur often bears intricate, natural patterns
                                        resembling mazes, and their towering
                                        frames exude both mystery and wisdom. Originating as wardens of ancient
                                        dungeons, they are now invaluable guides in
                                        modern cities, where their ability to never lose their way makes them adept
                                        navigators and troubleshooters in crowded
                                        environments.

                                        Labyrinthine Minotaur culture is steeped in traditions of service and
                                        protection, with rites of passage that involve
                                        defending or solving labyrinths. To these Minotaurs, mazes are sacred spaces
                                        connecting them to their ancestors and
                                        their duty. Despite their intimidating presence, Labyrinthine Minotaurs are
                                        gentle and patient, earning respect as
                                        guides, mediators, and wise protectors.

                            including stripes, spots, and solid colors. Their faces resemble those of large
                            cats, with pointed ears, sharp teeth,
                            and distinctive whiskers. They have large, expressive eyes, well-adapted for
                            low-light vision, and their overall
                            appearance exudes both grace and strength.

                        <h4>Culture</h4>
                        <p>
                            Felidae culture is steeped in tradition and a deep connection with the natural
                            world. They have a profound respect for
                            nature's balance and often live in harmony with their surroundings. Skilled hunters
                            and trackers, they rely on their
                            innate abilities to stalk and catch prey. Additionally, Felidae have a strong
                            affinity for music and storytelling,
                            with folklore passed down through generations in the form of songs and tales.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Social Structure</h4>
                        <p>
                            Felidae society is divided into close-knit communities called prides, usually led by
                            a dominant individual or a small
                            group of leaders. These prides consist of families and friends who work together to
                            protect their territory and meet
                            the group's needs. Felidae are fiercely loyal to their pride and will go to great
                            lengths to defend it from external
                            threats.

                                        Living primarily in the coastal regions around the Vozian Sea, the Paka are
                                        masterful sailors, traders, and
                                        artisans. Their maritime culture thrives on exploration, trade, and
                                        craftsmanship, with their ships doubling as
                                        floating galleries of intricate carvings and vibrant colors. Once rulers of
                                        ancient kingdoms, the Paka now live in
                                        communities shaped by the remnants of their lost empires, blending nostalgia
                                        with resilience. Despite the loss of
                                        their lands to the Ostrio Empire, the Paka remain resourceful, using their sharp

                                        in a competitive world.

                                    <p>
                                        The Kivuli, or Panthari, are enigmatic and elusive Felidae, often called the
                                        "Shadows of the Jungle." Living in dense
                                        forests or hidden enclaves, they are masters of stealth and ambush tactics.
                                        Their black or darkly patterned fur allows
                                        them to blend seamlessly with their surroundings, making them nearly invisible
                                        in low light. Kivuli culture revolves
                                        around safeguarding ancient knowledge and defending sacred jungle sites. While
                                        they prefer to remain unseen, their
                                        swift and precise strikes leave an unforgettable mark on those who threaten
                                        their home.

                                        Their society values cunning over brute strength, with elders teaching younger
                                        generations the art of patience,
                                        observation, and precision. Kivuli legends speak of "Night Stalkers," legendary
                                        warriors who once protected entire
                                        regions with unmatched stealth and agility.

                                    <p>
                                        The Mwendokasi, or Cheetari, are the fastest of all Felidae, known for their
                                        unmatched speed and agility. Found in open
                                        savannahs or expansive grasslands, their slim, muscular builds allow them to
                                        outrun nearly any predator—or prey.
                                        Mwendokasi are revered as messengers, scouts, and first responders in times of
                                        conflict, carrying vital information
                                        across vast distances.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Their culture celebrates swiftness as both a survival tool and a spiritual
                                        connection to the wind. Ritual foot races and
                                        endurance trials are key traditions, showcasing their speed as an offering to
                                        the spirits of the plains. Legends tell
                                        of Nyayo za Upepo (Steps of the Wind), Mwendokasi who could run so fast they
                                        seemed to disappear entirely, leaving only
                                        a trail of wind behind them.

                        <h3>Half Cloven</h3>
                        <p>
                            Half Cloven are a group of large, herbivorous humanoid creatures that share traits

                            Known for their impressive size, strength, and unique abilities, they are generally
                            peaceful but can become fearsome
                            opponents when needed. Despite their imposing appearance, Half Cloven possess a
                            charm and gentle demeanor that endears
                            them to many.

                            such as the Hippokin's
                            hippopotamus-like features, the Elephantine's elephantine traits, and the Roxodon's
                            rhinoceros-like appearance.

                            tight-knit groups, working together to ensure the safety and well-being of all
                            members. Their connection to the land

                            wisdom and experience. Decisions
                            are made collectively, giving each member a voice in matters that concern them.
                            Family bonds and friendships are
                            deeply important, and they go to great lengths to support and protect their loved

                                        The Hippokin are contemplative and wise, resembling humanoid hippopotamuses.
                                        Known for their love of rivers and
                                        marshlands, they are natural swimmers and builders, often constructing homes
                                        along waterways. Hippokin are revered
                                        for their intellect and ingenuity, focusing on crafting, invention, and the
                                        exchange of ideas. Their communities serve
                                        as hubs for trade and knowledge, enriching their regions with innovation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Hippokin take pride in their calm and measured demeanor, often acting as
                                        mediators and problem-solvers. However, when
                                        roused to action, their immense strength and nearly impenetrable hide make them
                                        formidable opponents. Hippokin warriors
                                        are known for using water as a tactical advantage, drawing enemies into terrain
                                        they control.

                                        of balance: fierce in defense of their kin but equally compassionate and
                                        generous. Roxodon warriors are celebrated for
                                        charging into battle, using their horns to scatter enemies and break through
                                        defenses.

                            The Gliers are small, swift, and resourceful beastmen who embody boundless energy
                            and unrelenting curiosity. These
                            diminutive humanoids are as diverse in appearance as they are in culture, with each

                            the small mammals they resemble. Gliers thrive on their quick wits, nimble

                            to their surroundings. Though often underestimated due to their size, their
                            ingenuity and industrious nature have
                            earned them a place in nearly every corner of the world.

                            prefer the safety of forests,
                            rivers, or burrows, others wander endlessly, drawn by the thrill of discovery. Their
                            quick speech and fast-paced lives
                            often leave larger creatures struggling to keep up. Yet, for all their restlessness,
                            Gliers form deep bonds with those
                            they trust, standing by their allies with fierce loyalty. Whether crafting gadgets,
                            hoarding treasures, or exploring
                            unknown lands, the Gliers bring vibrancy and cleverness to all they touch.

                                        the underground as much as possible. Despite this, Leporidae remain humble and

                                        Molefolk are subterranean Gliers with strong, clawed hands designed for digging.
                                        Thriving underground, they excavate
                                        vast tunnel systems for their homes and communities. Resourceful and resilient,
                                        Molefolk are perfectly adapted to life
                                        in dark and confined spaces.

                            physical appearances and abilities. They are an ancient and resilient race, able to
                            adapt and survive in a variety of
                            environments.

                        <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                        <p>
                            Reptilia typically stand between 5-7 ft tall, with bodies covered in tough, scaly
                            skin that comes in a variety of
                            colors and patterns. They have elongated, lizard-like heads with sharp teeth and
                            slit-like eyes. Some Reptilia have
                            tails, while others possess frills, crests, or spines along their bodies. Their
                            limbs are strong and muscular, with
                            clawed fingers and toes.

                        <p>
                            Reptilia communities are often found in warm climates such as deserts, jungles, and
                            swamps, where they bask in the sun
                            to regulate their body temperatures. They have a strong connection to the natural
                            world and are skilled hunters and
                            foragers. While often stoic and reserved, they form strong bonds with others and are
                            fiercely loyal to their families
                            and communities.

                                        The She-Ren are a race of snake-like humanoids who see the human form as
                                        something that can always be improved. Their
                                        bodies are a blend of human and snake features, with some individuals having
                                        snake-like lower halves they use to
                                        constrict enemies. They often adorn themselves with jewelry, tattoos, and
                                        undergo magical or mechanical augmentations
                                        to enhance their abilities. Known for their venomous bites or powerful
                                        constriction abilities, She-Ren are both
                                        dangerous foes and valued allies.

                The Trinity of Plague—Gnolls, Scourge, and Vulturkin—are feared and reviled creatures born from

                Playing as these creatures
                would be exceptionally challenging in campaigns not centered around plague themes due to their

                        The Trinity of Plague is a powerful and feared force in the world, born from the god
                        Yeeshnu. This alliance of Gnolls,
                        Scourge, and Vulturkin represents the embodiment of plague and destruction, united in
                        their worship of their deity.
                        While each species is formidable on its own, together they form an unstoppable force of
                        strength, cunning, and mysticism.

                    <p>
                        The gnolls are fierce warriors, known for their immense strength and ferocity in battle.
                        The scourge are numerous and
                        cunning, using their vast numbers to overwhelm enemies. The vulturkin, on the other
                        hand, are powerful mystics, able to
                        wield and control the very essence of the plague itself. This trinity often leads cults
                        of plague-worshippers, granting
                        them boons in exchange for their devotion to Yeeshnu.

                        Members of the Trinity are outcasts in civilized lands, often killed on sight due to the
                        diseases they carry and the
                        fear they inspire. Playing as a member of the Trinity is a unique challenge, as their
                        presence will be met with caution
                        and distrust, even from allies.

                        <p>
                            Gnolls are a powerful and imposing species, born from the hyena lord Yeeshnu.
                            Known for their brute strength and
                            ferocity in battle, gnolls often lead bands of Scourge and Vulturkin, using
                            their physical dominance to
                            intimidate and control. Fiercely loyal to their clans, gnolls have a strong pack
                            mentality and will fiercely
                            defend their kin and territory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gnolls are carnivorous, known to hunt and devour their prey whole. Their
                            intimidating presence and unyielding
                            loyalty to their god Yeeshnu make them both fearsome enemies and controversial
                            allies.

                            Yeeshnu. Renowned for their intelligence and

                            achieve their goals. Omnivorous by
                            nature, they will eat almost anything but show a preference for meat. The

                            and the afterlife, often serving as spiritual leaders and guides for their
                            fellow Gnolls and Scourge. Known for their
                            elaborate burial rituals and ceremonies, they maintain a strong sense of

                            dead.

                    <p>
                        Size in the world of adventuring isn't merely a matter of height and weight; it's a
                        key
                        factor in determining how a creature interacts with its environment and other
                        beings.
                        From the tiniest insect skittering unseen beneath a leaf to the towering giants
                        striding
                        across mountain ranges, size affects reach, stealth, strength, and vulnerability. A
                        creature's size can determine the spaces it can traverse, the opponents it can
                        challenge, and the impact of its presence in any given situation. In a realm of
                        magic
                        and might, understanding size is crucial for survival and success.

                        peaks to deep mystical forests. Here, identity is not just male or female but also
                        includes the enigmatic dragon. Dragons, with their ancient magic, can fluidly shift
                        to
                        align with the souls of those they cherish. The changelings too, with their
                        transformative abilities, are not bound by any single form. In Shek, it's a gentle
                        reminder for all: never assume, for identity is a personal journey, unique as the
                        being
                        who walks its path.

                    <p>Curses add an exciting layer of strategy, tension, depth, and complexity to gameplay. By placing
                        a
                        curse on a character or item, players must weigh the risk versus reward of using it or
                        benefiting
                        from the curse's effects. While curses can grant powerful abilities or bonuses, they often come
                        with
                        significant drawbacks, creating a dynamic gameplay experience. Curses are not always malicious;
                        they
                        can stem from angels, tech lords, or other sources, adding an element of unpredictability and
                        customization to the game.</p>

                    <h3>Curse Progression</h3>
                    <p>Curses work similarly to Paths and Talents. Players can spend <strong>XP</strong> to gain
                        features from a curse, often
                        at a steep cost. Some curses require players to acquire bane features before unlocking powerful
                        boons. Curses offer a blend of complexity and customization, allowing characters to evolve
                        uniquely.

                                        checks related to identifying spells.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Wordbound:</strong> Each spell inscribed on your body pulses with power
                                        when
                                        a corresponding spell is cast nearby, causing discomfort but alerting you to the

                                        increases, adding a bonus to the damage or healing amount.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Inscribed Protection:</strong> The power of the inscriptions reaches its
                                        peak, creating a barrier around you. You gain immunity to one damage type of a

                                    <li><strong>Echoing Shield:</strong> Your inscriptions pulse with power whenever a

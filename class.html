                        <p>
                            As a Tank, your character embodies the very essence of strength, resilience, and
                            unyielding
                            fortitude. You are the shield that safeguards your allies, the bulwark that stands firm
                            in
                            the
                            face of the enemy onslaught. With every swing of your weapon, you command the
                            battlefield,
                            drawing the attention of foes and absorbing their blows that would otherwise kill your
                            companions and many other creatures as well. Your unmatched stamina and formidable armor
                            make
                            you a veritable living fortress, capable of withstanding onslaughts that would
                            obliterate
                            the
                            less hardy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, the Tank's might in combat comes with a trade-off. In situations that require
                            finesse,
                            diplomacy, or arcane knowledge, you may find yourself akin to a fish out of water. While
                            your
                            strength and endurance are beyond question, tasks that involve subtlety, stealth, or
                            intricate
                            problem-solving might present a challenge. It's in these moments that you'll need to
                            rely on
                            your allies, just as they depend on your unwavering protection in battle. As a Tank,
                            your
                            role
                            is not to master every situation, but to provide a rock-solid foundation from which your
                            group
                            can confront any danger. Always remember, true strength comes not just from physical
                            power,
                            but
                            from knowing your limits and trusting in your comrades.

                        Merchants can enhance their wealth by investing in businesses, which in turn
                        generate
                        more
                        Merchant Tokens. The initial cost and potential returns of these businesses are set
                        by
                        specific guidelines based on their size. Here are some example businesses:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Small Business:</strong> A local bakery.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medium Enterprise:</strong> A town's blacksmith.</li>
                        <li><strong>Large Corporation:</strong> A citywide trade network.</li>

                        Collaborate with your narrator to determine the specifics of your chosen business.
                        Remember,
                        running a business incurs operating costs. For instance, owning a stable implies
                        expenses
                        for horses, maintenance, etc. Though the system simplifies this aspect, players can
                        further
                        integrate their businesses into gameplay, using them as hubs or even hiring other
                        party
                        members.

                        Each in-game month, Merchants assess the performance of their ventures through an
                        Earnings
                        check. This determines the monthly profit. Factors influencing this check include
                        the
                        business's
                        nature and scale, the game world's economic climate, and notable events of the past
                        month.

                        For this check, opt for either a d20 or d100 roll. Multiply the result (as a
                        percentage)
                        by
                        your
                        business's potential monthly earnings to calculate your total token profit for that

                            investments. While these ventures often require less upfront capital, they come
                            with
                            higher risks and potential consequences. The initial outlay and potential

                            these illicit businesses are outlined in specific guidelines, varying by their
                            scale
                            and scope. Here are some example ventures:

                            be lower, the stakes are higher. Legal repercussions, rival gangs, and moral
                            dilemmas are just some of the challenges you might face. These ventures can also
                            serve as intriguing plot points, bases of operations, or even ensnare other

                        <p>
                            For those Merchants embroiled in the underworld, monthly profits are a dance
                            with
                            danger. Every in-game month, perform an Underworld Earnings check to gauge the
                            illicit gains. The outcome can be swayed by the type of operation, its reach,
                            the
                            region's law enforcement vigilance, and unexpected events, such as rival gang
                            confrontations or heists gone wrong.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Choose to roll either a d20 or d100 for this check. Take the result (as a
                            percentage) and multiply it by your venture's potential monthly earnings to
                            deduce
                            your total token haul for the month. But remember, higher rewards often come
                            with
                            greater risks.

                            As a mage, you are a weaver of magic and a master of mysterious forces. Your power is
                            formidable, but it's also unpredictable, and you'll need a creative mind to control it.
                            Unlike
                            other classes, your spellcasting doesn't rely on a pre-set list of spells. Instead, you
                            combine
                            magic words to create your own unique spells. This path is not without its risks and
                            challenges.
                            Your magic can have both positive and negative outcomes, and it's crucial to learn how
                            to
                            manage
                            these ups and downs. One of the crucial aspects of being a mage is the practice of
                            recording
                            and
                            sharing your knowledge. Whether you pass on your wisdom through spellbooks or spiritual
                            knowledge transfer, your experiences and discoveries become a legacy for future
                            characters
                            you
                            play because they all share your soul.

                            An Excerpt from the Treatise on Arcane Oppositions by Professor Essley Yahir, the
                            Esteemed Historian of Magic, Magic in all things, and Magical Theory, of the Stonetooth
                            Academy of Magic the Gathering
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “In the vast cosmos of magical energies, the origins of magic types are as diverse as
                            the stars in the night sky. Each form of magic, while unique in its essence, finds its
                            place in the grand tapestry of the arcane, often standing in stark opposition to
                            another. This opposition, far from being a source of conflict, is a testament to the
                            balance that governs our universe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Arcane magic, the purest form of magical energy, stands in opposition to the
                            unpredictable and often destructive Chaos magic. Basic magic, the foundation of all
                            magical learning, finds its counter in the complex and time-bending Chronomancy which
                            most regard as the most plot bending of all magics. Celestial magic, drawing its power
                            from the cosmos and heavenly bodies, is opposed by the ground-bound and ancient Vozian
                            magic. Dragon magic, a powerful and ancient form tied to the mythical creatures
                            themselves, is in opposition to Nature magic, which draws its strength from the living
                            world around us, and as many of us know dragons were the first of the outer planar
                            beings to come to Shek. Elemental magic, harnessing the raw power of the natural
                            elements, stands in contrast to the refined and structured Crystal magic. Life magic,
                            the nurturing force that promotes growth and healing, finds its counter in the
                            mechanical and precise Tech magic.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Understanding these oppositions is not merely an academic exercise. It is a journey
                            towards understanding the fundamental laws that govern our universe and the magical
                            energies that flow within it. As scholars of the arcane, we must strive to understand
                            these relationships, not to exploit them, but to respect the delicate balance they
                            represent and to harness our powers responsibly. Remember, dear students, in the grand
                            scheme of the cosmos, opposition is not about conflict, but about balance and harmony.”

                            enormous,
                            but the road to mastery is fraught with challenge. You're not merely casting spells -
                            you're
                            shaping reality. Choose your path wisely, and let your knowledge be your legacy.

                            Mana Pools serve as the mage's wellspring of magical energy, a core aspect
                            distinguishing their capabilities and defining their unique connection to the arcane.
                            Unlike talents, which may rely on innate skill or physical prowess, Mana Pools tap
                            directly into the raw essence of magic itself. Each mage draws from their own distinct
                            source of power, shaping the spells they cast and the magic they wield. Below are
                            several Mana Pool options, each offering a different origin for a mage's magical power

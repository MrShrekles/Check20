                        As a Tank, your character embodies the very essence of strength, resilience, and
                        unyielding
                        fortitude. You are the shield that safeguards your allies, the bulwark that stands firm
                        in
                        the
                        face of the enemy onslaught. With every swing of your weapon, you command the
                        battlefield,
                        drawing the attention of foes and absorbing their blows that would otherwise kill your
                        companions and many other creatures as well. Your unmatched stamina and formidable armor
                        make
                        you a veritable living fortress, capable of withstanding onslaughts that would
                        obliterate
                        the
                        less hardy.

                    <p>
                        However, the Tank's might in combat comes with a trade-off. In situations that require
                        finesse,
                        diplomacy, or arcane knowledge, you may find yourself akin to a fish out of water. While
                        your
                        strength and endurance are beyond question, tasks that involve subtlety, stealth, or
                        intricate
                        problem-solving might present a challenge. It's in these moments that you'll need to
                        rely on
                        your allies, just as they depend on your unwavering protection in battle. As a Tank,
                        your
                        role
                        is not to master every situation, but to provide a rock-solid foundation from which your
                        group
                        can confront any danger. Always remember, true strength comes not just from physical
                        power,
                        but
                        from knowing your limits and trusting in your comrades.

                        A shrewd and resourceful individual who knows how to make a profit no matter the
                        circumstances.
                        The Merchant is a master of trade and commerce, always looking for new opportunities to
                        expand
                        their business and increase their wealth. They are not content to simply rely on combat
                        and
                        adventuring to earn a living. Instead, they think beyond these traditional means and use
                        their
                        wits and cunning to get ahead. Whether it's looking for valuable items to sell or
                        stealing
                        from
                        a dragon's hoard to further a political campaign, the Merchant of Adventure is always
                        one
                        step
                        ahead.

                            Merchants can enhance their wealth by investing in businesses, which in turn
                            generate
                            more
                            Merchant Tokens. The initial cost and potential returns of these businesses are set
                            by
                            specific guidelines based on their size. Here are some example businesses:

                            Remember,
                            running a business incurs operating costs. For instance, owning a stable implies
                            expenses
                            for horses, maintenance, etc. Though the system simplifies this aspect, players can
                            further
                            integrate their businesses into gameplay, using them as hubs or even hiring other
                            party

                            <p>
                                For those Merchants embroiled in the underworld, monthly profits are a dance
                                with
                                danger. Every in-game month, perform an Underworld Earnings check to gauge the
                                illicit gains. The outcome can be swayed by the type of operation, its reach,
                                the
                                region's law enforcement vigilance, and unexpected events, such as rival gang
                                confrontations or heists gone wrong.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Choose to roll either a d20 or d100 for this check. Take the result (as a
                                percentage) and multiply it by your venture's potential monthly earnings to
                                deduce
                                your total token haul for the month. But remember, higher rewards often come
                                with
                                greater risks.

                                As a mage, you are a weaver of magic and a master of mysterious forces. Your power is
                                formidable, but it's also unpredictable, and you'll need a creative mind to control it.
                                Unlike
                                other classes, your spellcasting doesn't rely on a pre-set list of spells. Instead, you
                                combine
                                magic words to create your own unique spells. This path is not without its risks and
                                challenges.
                                Your magic can have both positive and negative outcomes, and it's crucial to learn how
                                to
                                manage
                                these ups and downs. One of the crucial aspects of being a mage is the practice of
                                recording
                                and
                                sharing your knowledge. Whether you pass on your wisdom through spellbooks or spiritual
                                knowledge transfer, your experiences and discoveries become a legacy for future
                                characters

                                An Excerpt from the Treatise on Arcane Oppositions by Professor Essley Yahir, the
                                Esteemed Historian of Magic, Magic in all things, and Magical theory, of the Stonetooth
                                Academy of Magic the Gathering
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “In the vast cosmos of magical energies, the origins of magic types are as diverse as
                                the stars in the night sky. Each form of magic, while unique in its essence, finds its
                                place in the grand tapestry of the arcane, often standing in stark opposition to
                                another. This opposition, far from being a source of conflict, is a testament to the
                                balance that governs our universe.
                                Arcane magic, the purest form of magical energy, stands in opposition to the
                                unpredictable and often destructive Chaos magic. Basic magic, the foundation of all
                                magical learning, finds its counter in the complex and time-bending Chronomancy which
                                most regard as the most plot bending of all magics. Celestial magic, drawing its power
                                from the cosmos and heavenly bodies, is opposed by the ground-bound and ancient Vozian
                                magic. Dragon magic, a powerful and ancient form tied to the mythical creatures
                                themselves, is in opposition to Nature magic, which draws its strength from the living
                                world around us, and as many of us know dragons were the first of the outer planar
                                beings to come to Shek. Elemental magic, harnessing the raw power of the natural n
                                elements, stands in contrast to the refined and structured Crystal magic. Life magic,
                                the nurturing force that promotes growth and healing, finds its counter in the
                                mechanical and precise Tech magic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Understanding these oppositions is not merely an academic exercise. It is a journey
                                towards understanding the fundamental laws that govern our universe and the magical
                                energies that flow within it. As scholars of the arcane, we must strive to understand
                                these relationships, not to exploit them, but to respect the delicate balance they
                                represent and to harness our powers responsibly. Remember, dear students, in the grand
                                scheme of the cosmos, opposition is not about conflict, but about balance and harmony.”

                                enormous,
                                but the road to mastery is fraught with challenge. You're not merely casting spells -

                                Mana Pools serve as the mage's wellspring of magical energy, a core aspect
                                distinguishing their capabilities and defining their unique connection to the arcane.
                                Unlike talents, which may rely on innate skill or physical prowess, Mana Pools tap
                                directly into the raw essence of magic itself. Each mage draws from their own distinct
                                source of power, shaping the spells they cast and the magic they wield. Below are
                                several Mana Pool options, each offering a different origin for a mage's magical power

                    <p>
                        Size in the world of adventuring isn't merely a matter of height and weight; it's a
                        key
                        factor in determining how a creature interacts with its environment and other
                        beings.
                        From the tiniest insect skittering unseen beneath a leaf to the towering giants
                        striding
                        across mountain ranges, size affects reach, stealth, strength, and vulnerability. A
                        creature's size can determine the spaces it can traverse, the opponents it can
                        challenge, and the impact of its presence in any given situation. In a realm of
                        magic
                        and might, understanding size is crucial for survival and success.

                    <h3>Gender</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the realm of Shek, gender is as varied as the landscapes that stretch from
                        soaring
                        peaks to deep mystical forests. Here, identity is not just male or female but also
                        includes the enigmatic dragon. Dragons, with their ancient magic, can fluidly shift
                        to
                        align with the souls of those they cherish. The changelings too, with their
                        transformative abilities, are not bound by any single form. In Shek, it's a gentle
                        reminder for all: never assume, for identity is a personal journey, unique as the
                        being
                        who walks its path.

                    <p>Curses add an exciting layer of strategy, tension, depth, and complexity to gameplay. By placing
                        a
                        curse on a character or item, players must weigh the risk versus reward of using it or
                        benefiting
                        from the curse's effects. While curses can grant powerful abilities or bonuses, they often come
                        with
                        significant drawbacks, creating a dynamic gameplay experience. Curses are not always malicious;
                        they
                        can stem from angels, tech lords, or other sources, adding an element of unpredictability and
                        customization to the game.</p>

                    <h3>Curse Progression</h3>
                    <p>Curses work similarly to Paths and Talents. Players can spend <strong>XP</strong> to gain
                        features from a curse, often
                        at a steep cost. Some curses require players to acquire bane features before unlocking powerful
                        boons. Curses offer a blend of complexity and customization, allowing characters to evolve
                        uniquely.

                                    <li><strong>Wordbound:</strong> Each spell inscribed on your body pulses with power
                                        when
                                        a corresponding spell is cast nearby, causing discomfort but alerting you to the

                                        peak, creating a barrier around you. You gain immunity to one damage type of a

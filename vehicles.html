            <section id="mounted-combat">
                <h2>Mounted Combat</h2>
                <p>Mounted combat stands as a thrilling fusion of tradition and innovation. Knights and daredevils
                    alike
                    take to the streets and skies, not on horses, but on mechanized steeds and mystical creatures.
                    Here,
                    a well-timed cavalry charge might be led by a line of sleek motorcycles, while Pegasus-mounted
                    aces
                    could duel among the skyscrapers. In this era, the mounted warrior's valor is matched only by
                    the
                    speed of their mount, be it flesh or steel, feathered or geared.</p>

                <h3>Rules for Mounted Combat</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mount Movement:</strong> The base speed for beasts of burden such as horses is 60
                        ft.
                        Speed for other creatures used as mounts will be determined based on their type and size.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Target Selection:</strong> Enemies may choose to direct their attacks at either you
                        or
                        your mount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dismounting & Mounting:</strong> Exiting your mount requires either the expenditure
                        of
                        20 ft of movement or an action, and the same for mounting a creature or vehicle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mount Abilities:</strong> Different types of mounts provide various abilities and
                        combat
                        options. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Warhorse:</strong> Might grant a charge ability that allows for a powerful
                                attack after moving a certain distance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flying Mount:</strong> Could offer aerial movement options, but with
                                limitations
                                on how long they can stay aloft or how they maneuver.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aquatic Mount:</strong> May allow for swift underwater movement and possibly
                                an
                                evasion bonus due to the fluid environment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

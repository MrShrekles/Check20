                    <p>Humans are a rare but influential creatures, known for their leadership within the

                        Over time, "human" has broadened to include other humanoids, yet "true humans" hold a
                        distinct
                        status, marked by their uncommon appearance and significant roles. Encountering a human

                        casual
                        settings, away from their typical authoritative contexts, can be surprising and leads to
                        whispered
                        speculations. This duality of reverence and suspicion underscores the complex legacy of
                        humans
                        in

                                    Changelings are rare and mysterious creatures, often misunderstood due to their
                                    supernatural
                                    origins and extraordinary abilities. They are the result of ancient interference
                                    by
                                    fey,
                                    fiendish, or otherworldly beings, who swapped their progeny with human children.
                                    This
                                    heritage ties them deeply to chaotic realms, giving them the unique ability to
                                    alter
                                    their
                                    physical appearance.

                                    Changelings have a strange and fascinating presence in the world. Their ability
                                    to
                                    shift
                                    their form allows them to adapt to almost any situation, but it also alienates
                                    them
                                    from
                                    others. This power often leads to them being both feared and sought after, with
                                    some
                                    becoming spies, diplomats, or performers, while others are wrongly associated
                                    with
                                    criminal
                                    or deceitful activities.

                                    adaptability, and unparalleled craftsmanship. With deep cultural roots and a

                                    history,
                                    Dwarves thrive in diverse environments both above and below ground. They are
                                    known
                                    for

                                    expertise in stonework, mining, and metallurgy, as well as their ability to
                                    create
                                    intricate
                                    structures and durable artifacts.

                                <p>
                                    Historically, Dwarves were integral members of a larger empire that united many
                                    species
                                    groups. However, they broke away following a dispute between their ruler, the
                                    Tyrant
                                    King,
                                    and the Emperor of the empire. This pivotal split shaped Dwarven culture,
                                    fostering
                                    an
                                    enduring sense of independence and self-reliance that continues to influence
                                    their
                                    society.

                                    Dwarves are a common sight in underground cities, where their communities are
                                    structured
                                    around craftsmanship, trade, and a rigid adherence to tradition. Despite their
                                    inclination
                                    toward self-sufficiency, Dwarves are far from isolationist. Their goods and

                                    are

                                        Nemuri Elves are deeply connected to the magic of dreams, often influencing
                                        the
                                        subconscious minds of others. They are gentle and enigmatic, moving
                                        effortlessly
                                        between
                                        the waking world and the realm of dreams. Nemuri Elves are often seen as
                                        spiritual
                                        guides, helping others confront their fears or explore hidden desires within
                                        their
                                        dreams. However, their dreamlike nature can make them seem distant or
                                        otherworldly.

                                        Elves, have carved a niche alongside the industrious Breaker Dwarves. As the

                                        passed, these elves have come to share more than just the subterranean

                                        seamlessly blends with the shadows. Their ethereal hair, reminiscent of

                                <h3>Kleinkind</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Small in stature but grand in spirit, the Kleinkind are a species as cozy as a
                                    well-worn
                                    quilt and as surprising as a jack-in-the-box. Often referred to as "Halflings"
                                    by
                                    outsiders,
                                    these delightful people weave a narrative claiming they were the first
                                    intelligent
                                    beings to
                                    grace the planet. Whether this is true or just a tale spun over a warm mug of
                                    cider,
                                    the
                                    Kleinkind hold their belief with pride (and no small amount of charm).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Kleinkind's hallmark is their love of community and comfort. Their villages
                                    are
                                    havens
                                    of merriment, where doors are always open, feasts are abundant, and every
                                    stranger
                                    is a
                                    friend waiting to be made. Their lives are painted with warmth and laughter,
                                    their
                                    hearths
                                    glowing as brightly as their spirits. But not all Kleinkind are content to stay
                                    within
                                    the
                                    snug borders of their idyllic enclaves. Some feel the pull of the road, a
                                    wanderlust
                                    that
                                    drives them to become Barnstormers—restless travelers who bring joy, stories,
                                    and
                                    just a
                                    touch of chaos wherever they go.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Physically, Kleinkind are marvels of density. Standing no taller than 2 feet,
                                    they
                                    are
                                    far
                                    heavier than their size suggests, with compact musculature that makes them
                                    unexpectedly
                                    sturdy. A 1-foot Kleinkind can weigh up to 60 pounds, leading to many a startled
                                    adventurer
                                    who underestimated their strength. Despite their heft, they move with surprising
                                    nimbleness,
                                    like a stone rolling downhill—steady and unstoppable.

                                            Desert Orcs used stone-moving magics and hard work to create stone dome
                                            structures
                                            in which they lived as large packs. Leadership was attained through

                                            with

                                            leader needing to fight everyone to calm disputes. Desert Orcs prefer to
                                            fight
                                            in

                                            The Green Jungle Orc is the most prevalent Orc option throughout the

                                    Known as Core Bound or The Forged, these entities were originally crafted by

                                    tinkerers
                                    who transferred dryads from their natural habitats into engineered cores. This
                                    fusion of
                                    natural essence and mechanical engineering gave rise to sentient beings encased
                                    in
                                    armor,
                                    powered by the very core of nature itself. While they were initially used in

                                    constructs lead full lives, capable of all human-like functions including

                                    connections. Efforts continue among scholars to unlock and reclaim memories from

                                    cores
                                    that might still linger from previous incarnations.

                                <p>
                                    The Ensuri are a mystical and enigmatic species, born from the union of humans and
                                    the primordial forces of the elements.
                                    Tracing their lineage back to the dawn of existence, the Ensuri embody the fierce
                                    power and untamed beauty of the natural world.
                                    Some among them hail from ancient families, their bloodlines intertwined with
                                    elemental spirits through sacred rites and ancient pacts.
                                    Others are the product of transformation, individuals who were altered by profound
                                    elemental events, forever changed by their exposure to raw elemental power.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With appearances as diverse as the elements themselves, the Ensuri possess traits
                                    reflective of their elemental heritage—skin that shimmers like the surface
                                    of a lake under moonlight for those of water lineage, or eyes that flicker with the
                                    undying flame of their fire ancestors. They are beings of both creation
                                    and destruction, capable of wielding their elemental powers with a natural ease that
                                    belies their human origins.

                                            The Air Ensuri are ethereal wanderers, drifting wherever the winds of fate
                                            carry them. With their airy conversations and light-hearted demeanor,
                                            they are the quintessential free spirits. Drawn to the mystical and
                                            powerful, they often find themselves in the company of dragons and
                                            dragonborn,
                                            believing that the wind is the breath of Khalas. Their culture is rich with
                                            music and dance that mimic the movements of the wind, and their nomadic
                                            tribes are known for their storytelling and vibrant festivals. They prefer
                                            light, airy foods such as soufflés, whipped cream, and fresh fruits,
                                            embodying their connection to the sky and freedom.

                                    Born from the merging of demonic energy and mortal essence, Helborn are beings of
                                    profound power and mystique.
                                    Each Options reflects the distinctive traits of the nine layers of Ordealis,
                                    making them as diverse as they are formidable.
                                    Their appearance varies from the metallic hues of the Iron Dominion to the eerie
                                    glow of the Clockwork Abyss, symbolizing their otherworldly origins.
                                    Helborn possess abilities that echo the realms they are connected to, from
                                    manipulating memories and time to mastering the elements of ice and sound.

                                    Despite being feared and often shunned by other species for their infernal heritage,
                                    many Helborn strive to transcend their ominous nature,
                                    proving that they can be as noble or malevolent as their choices dictate. Their
                                    society is complex, often shaped by the harsh realities of their birthright,
                                    yet enriched by a deep sense of kinship and survival.

                                            The Abyssal Helborn is a creature of darkness and otherworldly power. Its
                                            skin glows with the ethereal hues of twilight, and its body is adorned with
                                            sharp and asymmetrical horns.
                                            They are feared and shunned by society due to their otherworldly origins,
                                            but they possess a culture that is rich and mysterious. They are known to be
                                            powerful and formidable, but also
                                            quite reclusive, choosing to keep to themselves and their own kind.

                                        <p>
                                            They believe in the power of the abyss and are said to possess the ability
                                            to ensnare the souls of those they grapple with, drawing them into the
                                            abyss. Often viewed as loners, they can
                                            also be part of a tight-knit community. They are very protective of their
                                            own kind and will fiercely defend them if threatened. Some are quite wise
                                            and knowledgeable, possessing ancient
                                            secrets not shared with outsiders. They have a strong sense of pride and
                                            honor, with unwavering loyalty to their own.

                                <h3>Seraphim</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In the vast tapestry of existence, few beings hold as revered a position as the
                                    Seraphim. These celestial entities stand as shining paragons of devotion,
                                    embodying the zenith of spiritual commitment. To become a Seraphim is not merely an
                                    elevation in form but a testament to the unyielding faith and dedication
                                    one holds to their chosen deity or creed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many Seraphim were once mortals, fervent clerics and paladins who, through their
                                    unwavering service, found themselves transformed, touched by the divine essence
                                    of their deity. These chosen ones shed their mortal coil, ascending to a state of
                                    celestial grace, their very being infused with holy energy. Their previous lives
                                    as guardians of faith on the material plane set the foundation for their new
                                    existence as divine emissaries, bridging the gap between the heavens and the earthly
                                    realms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yet, not all Seraphim are born from acts of devout mortals. Ancient lineages of
                                    these celestial beings have existed since the dawn of time, chronicled in age-old
                                    scriptures and cosmic legends. These primordial Seraphim are believed to be the
                                    first of their kind, created by the gods themselves to serve as their most trusted
                                    advisors and guardians.

                                            the Ancestral Seraphim are born of divinity and grace. Their lineage traces
                                            back to those rare and powerful angels who, out of curiosity or perhaps
                                            love, descended
                                            from their celestial realms to experience life among the mortals.

                                            forms and even starting families. Their celestial essence became diluted
                                            with each generation,
                                            but never truly vanished. This essence manifested in their descendants as
                                            the Ancestral Seraphim.

                                <p>
                                    Birthed from the infinite expanse of the Dreamsea, Etherians stand as curious
                                    amalgamations of the tangible and the intangible.
                                    These beings, molded from the vivid dreams and profound fears of countless dreaming
                                    souls, encapsulate the raw emotions that gave rise to them.
                                    Possessing a form as malleable as a fleeting thought yet as permanent as the deepest
                                    desires, Etherians can transition seamlessly between their ethereal
                                    origins and the physical realm.
                                </p>

                                    Their unique existence grants them unparalleled prowess in navigating dreams. Many,
                                    drawn by intrigue or purpose, have ventured into the waking world.
                                    Here, they find themselves endowed with the remarkable ability to delve into and
                                    influence the dreams of mortals, ranging from the most tranquil visions
                                    to the darkest of nightmares. This talent has made them both a beacon of fascination
                                    and a source of trepidation. While some seek them out for guidance
                                    through their own subconscious labyrinths, others view them with suspicion, wary of
                                    their potential to invoke tormenting nightmares.

                                    Despite their playful and often mischievous demeanor, these Etherians can exhibit
                                    unpredictable temperaments, especially if provoked. Their fluid nature
                                    makes them adept at blending into the world's myriad landscapes, yet a profound
                                    disconnect remains. Deep down, they grapple with understanding the unwavering
                                    certainties of the waking world, a stark contrast to the ever-shifting sands of the
                                    Dreamsea from which they emerged.

                                            The Dreamborn are a species of humanoid creatures born from the realm of
                                            dreams, the Dreamsea. They possess an ethereal and otherworldly presence,
                                            and are known for their fun-loving and joyful nature. Their mere presence
                                            has a way of bringing out the best in others, spreading positivity and joy
                                            wherever they go.
                                            They possess a unique ability to tap into the subconscious minds of those
                                            around them, interpreting and manifesting their deepest desires and fondest
                                            dreams.
                                            They can be familiar yet elusive, as if they are constantly drifting in and
                                            out of reality. They are a peaceful and harmonious species, who value
                                            community and connection above all else.
                                            They are often seen as the embodiment of hope and inspiration, and are
                                            greatly respected and admired by those who are lucky enough to encounter

                                            They possess a distorted and monstrous appearance, resembling twisted

                    <h3>Goblijjins</h3>
                    <p>
                        Deep within the annals of history, the Goblijjins emerged from the very essence of VoZo,
                        the Primordial Evil that once threatened to consume Shek.
                        Born of chaos and malevolence, their early ancestors were feared, loathed, and branded
                        as the living symbols of evil's persistence in the world.
                        Yet, time has a way of reshaping destinies, and the Goblijjins of today are a testament
                        to that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the sprawling grasslands to the hidden alleyways of cities, Goblijjins have found
                        their place. While the shadow of their sinister lineage does loom
                        over them, the Goblijjins have strived hard to redefine themselves. But society, often
                        harsh and unforgiving, has rarely been welcoming. To most, Goblijjins are
                        still the remnants of an era best forgotten, and they face the brunt of that prejudice.
                        With the deck stacked against them, many Goblijjins embrace roles that benefit
                        the greater good, hoping to find a measure of acceptance. Yet, the world remains wary,
                        keeping them at arm's length.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In their heart of hearts, every Goblijjin struggles with their innate mischievous
                        nature. Whether it's a sly prank, a cheeky comment, or simply being a "little stinker,"
                        it's hardwired into their very being. It's not just a choice; it's a part of who they
                        are, a reminder of their tumultuous origin. This playful, sometimes disruptive,
                        behavior often gets them into trouble, further alienating them from other species. Their
                        names, often odd and humorous like "Snotbubble" or "Wiggletoe," are a reflection
                        of their unique culture and perspective on life. For a species with such a fleeting
                        lifespan, every moment is a celebration, every day a dance. There's a saying among
                        Goblijjins:
                        "Live for the giggle, for tomorrow we might not be here to hear it." And live they do,
                        with a fervor and zest that few can match.

                        One of the most distinct characteristics of the Goblijjins is their black, flaky blood.
                        When exposed to the air, it crystallizes and turns to ash, drifting away with the wind.
                        A poignant metaphor for their transient lives, perhaps. Despite the challenges they
                        face, the Goblijjins are a testament to resilience, adaptability, and the indomitable
                        spirit
                        to rise above one's origins. While the world may not always be kind to them, the
                        Goblijjins of Shek continue to carve out their place, one mischievous giggle at a time.

                                    The Goblins are the most prolific of the Goblijjin. Their rapid proliferation
                                    throughout the world is a testament to their adaptability and resilience.
                                    From the sprawling grasslands to the deepest, forgotten dungeons, one can find
                                    traces of these tenacious beings. Their language, a unique dialect known as
                                    "Gutter Common," stands as a symbol of their distinct identity, even if it's often
                                    misunderstood by others.

                                            In the vast stretches of Shek's untamed wilderness, the Wild Goblins thrive.
                                            These little rascals, often named with playful and bizarre monikers
                                            like "Gigglemud" or "Plopfoot", live in transient communities that rise and
                                            fall with the seasons. Their lives are a blend of mischief and survival,
                                            as they harness their innate cunning to navigate the challenges of the wild.
                                            Wild Goblins are known for their unyielding spirit and an uncanny ability
                                            to adapt quickly to their surroundings, making them elusive adversaries and
                                            curious allies.

                                            The bustling streets of Shek's cities are home to a different breed of
                                            goblins - the City Goblins. They have traded the vast open wilderness for
                                            the intricate
                                            labyrinths of urban life. Dressed in whatever finery they can acquire, often
                                            with an eccentric flair, these goblins are savvy traders, skilled artisans,
                                            and street-smart entrepreneurs.
                                            Their names often reflect their trades or peculiar habits, leading to
                                            goblins called "Silkthread" or "Dingledangle". Even in the cities, their
                                            mischievous nature shines,
                                            but it's tempered with a keen sense of business acumen.

                                    Hojgoblins, often considered the matured cousins of goblins, are a testament to
                                    evolution or perhaps a stroke of magical chance.
                                    Some say they were born of goblins who consumed enchanted fruits, while others argue
                                    they were deliberately shaped by arcane forces.
                                    Whatever the case, Hojgoblins have carved a niche for themselves as strategic
                                    masterminds and refined engineers. Their reputation precedes them;
                                    many war generals eagerly seek their counsel in battles, while cities benefit from
                                    their architectural prowess. Yet, with heightened intelligence comes a darker side.
                                    Some Hojgoblins find themselves on a perilous edge, where overthinking can spiral
                                    into madness. This duality of genius and potential instability makes them a complex
                                    and fascinating race in the world of Shek.

                                            Amid the untamed expanses, the Wild Hojgoblins reign supreme. Their tribes,

                                            survivors, but dominant forces in the wild. Their keen strategic minds,
                                            always a step ahead,
                                            combined with their raw physical prowess, make them a force to be reckoned
                                            with. To challenge a Wild Hojgoblin is to challenge the very essence of
                                            survival itself.

                    <h3>Giants</h3>
                    <p>
                        Giants, once formidable beings of incomprehensible might and stature, have become
                        entities shrouded in enigma and dark tales.
                        Thousands of years prior, their kind, the True Giants, were expelled or driven from the
                        prime material plane through a tumult of cosmic-scale events and ethereal politics
                        that were far beyond their control or comprehension. Yet, the ripple of their ancient
                        presence still lingers hauntingly across the lands, and their descendants, although
                        diminished,
                        tread cautiously in a world that has grown wary of their lineage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The True Giants, beings of incredible power and stature, were banished to the distant
                        realms by the celestial powers, forever locked away from the prime material plane due to
                        a cascade
                        of cataclysmic occurrences and divine interventions. Their banishment, wrought with
                        sorrow and wrath, echoed through the cosmos, leaving a scar in the collective memory of
                        all beings in Shek.
                        Even now, these giants, known as the "Banished", linger in their distant, secluded
                        realms, their hearts heavy with the burden of lost epochs and a deep yearning for the
                        world they were torn away from.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the contemporary epoch of Shek, those of giant lineage walk a precarious path,
                        ever-shadowed by the colossal specters of their ancestors. Three distinct species of
                        half-giants, each bearing
                        the diluted yet still formidable blood of their forebears, inhabit the world, each
                        uniquely adapted to their struggle for acceptance and survival amidst a populace that
                        regards them with a mixture
                        of awe and trepidation.

                                    tell a tale of a pact wrought from the abyss, trading loyalty for unfathomable
                                    power. Intimidation is their language, and through the shadows, they weave their

                        <div class="column">
                            <p>
                                In the epoch before recorded time, Shek was a tempestuous realm, constantly wracked by
                                the chaotic fury of the elements. This world, brimming with raw elemental potential,
                                was a cacophony of roaring thunder, raging infernos, surging tides, and howling gales.
                                It was during this tumultuous age that the God Dragon Khalas descended upon Shek,
                                drawn by the planet's untamed energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Khalas, a colossal being of indescribable magnificence, bore scales that shimmered with
                                the luminescence of a thousand stars. With wings vast enough to blanket entire
                                cities and eyes that held the wisdom of the cosmos, Khalas was a deity of unparalleled
                                power. As the mighty dragon landed, the storms themselves seemed to bow before
                                this majestic entity, waiting in bated anticipation. Drawing upon an ancient and arcane
                                rite, Khalas inhaled deeply, absorbing the wild elemental tempests that raged
                                across Shek. Every bolt of lightning, every lick of flame, every gust of wind, and every
                                crashing wave was drawn into the God Dragon's maw. The very fabric of the world
                                held its breath, and for a brief moment, an eerie calm descended upon Shek.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then, with an exhalation that resonated with the force of creation itself, Khalas
                                birthed the Crumbling Void. This vast expanse, a space where the elements met
                                and melded, became a canvas upon which new life would be painted. With each subsequent
                                breath, Khalas infused the void with fragments of the elements, giving birth
                                to the myriad species of dragons that would come to populate Shek.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From the fiery breath of Khalas came the Crimson Pyre Dragons, embodiments of flame and
                                fury. The cool exhalations birthed the Glacial Shard Dragons, masters of frost
                                and ice. The gentle sighs brought forth the Cloudburst Dragons, rulers of the skies and
                                storms. And so, with each breath, a new lineage of dragons was formed, each inheriting
                                a fragment of Khalas's elemental might.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="column">
                            <p>
                                In the ages that followed, these dragons would go on to shape the history and destiny of
                                Shek. They carved out territories, established dynasties, and played pivotal roles
                                in the world's evolving narrative. Yet, they never forgot their divine origins, always
                                paying homage to Khalas, the God Dragon who breathed life into their kind.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though Khalas's physical presence has long since faded from Shek, the legacy of that
                                fateful day remains. The dragons, in all their elemental splendor, are a testament
                                to the God Dragon's creative force. They are not just creatures of myth and legend, but
                                living embodiments of Shek's primal history, forever soaring through its skies,
                                guarding its secrets, and shaping its future.

                                            and are often found in caves or marshes. Their scales are smooth,
                                            olive-green,
                                            transitioning to yellow on their underbelly, and
                                            they have forward-curving horns like a ram. Bile Dragons are cunning,

                                            and can be fiercely protective of their habitats.

                                            underbellies, ranging from the deepest twilight to the brightest dawn.
                                            Their breath weapon is a devastating beam of concentrated solar energy,

                                            friends, often attracting a retinue of ghosts and spirits.
                                            Despite their intimidating appearance, they're gentle giants who prefer

                                            Barb Dragons are bigger than average dragons and have bulkier bodies. They
                                            are
                                            covered in muted-hued, thorny scales that not only serve as armor
                                            but also as a weapon. These dragons have limited intellect and are driven
                                            primarily by instinct and hunger. They are territorial and aggressive
                                            towards intruders, who often find themselves faced with a cloud of sharp
                                            spikes
                                            when encroaching on a Barb Dragon's domain.

                                            covered in metallic scales that gleam in the sunlight.
                                            They have large, curved horns and a thick, bladed tail that's as deadly as

                                    You bear features of both lineages—scales glinting like armor, eyes glowing
                                    with ancient wisdom, and a humanoid form that stands tall and proud. Your

                                    dragon lineage, and dragons are skeptical of your human side. But the
                                    potential within you is undeniable.
                                    How you wield this power, whether for good or ill, is your choice. Prove to
                                    the world that being a "bad dragon" means being extraordinarily formidable,
                                    not feared.

                    <p>
                        The Greenborn are a diverse collective of plant and fungal species, embodying the
                        vibrant, untamed spirit of nature itself. Rooted in the ancient magic of the natural
                        world, they serve as protectors, nurturers, and guardians of the verdant realms. Whether
                        thriving in shadowy forests, sunlit groves, or misty marshlands, the Greenborn are
                        intrinsically tied to the life force of the land they inhabit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each Greenborn carries a fragment of the world’s primal vitality, their existence a
                        living testament to the endless cycles of growth, decay, and renewal. From the towering,
                        immovable Husk Otaota to the enigmatic, spore-filled Ciuperca, they are as varied as the
                        ecosystems they call home. These beings are not merely part of nature—they are nature,
                        walking and breathing embodiments of the earth’s will.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the Greenborn are often misunderstood or feared by other species, their wisdom
                        and connection to the land make them vital to maintaining the delicate balance of Shek’s
                        ecosystems. Through songs whispered on the wind, spores drifting through the air, or the
                        silent communion of roots beneath the soil, the Greenborn share a collective
                        consciousness that transcends words. They revere the ancient spirits of nature, honoring
                        their duty to protect the sacred groves, ancient forests, and untamed wilds that give
                        them life.

                                    Resembling a cross between human and tree, the Otaota’s bodies are adorned with
                                    leaves,
                                    glowing flowers, and sturdy

                                    Otaota villages are often hidden within vast, ancient forests or atop lush volcanic
                                    islands. These settlements are built
                                    in harmony with the environment, featuring homes carved into living trees, gardens
                                    tended by their plant allies, and
                                    totems adorned with intricate leaf patterns and glowing sap. Otaota celebrations are

                                        also cultivators of wild beauty,
                                        tending to resilient and hardy plants that thrive in difficult environments.
                                        Many Thorn Otaota paint their bark
                                        with natural dyes, adding to their fearsome appearance and creating living works
                                        of art that tell stories of their
                                        victories. Their bristling exterior hides a deeply rooted loyalty and love for
                                        their people, making them valued
                                        members of their communities.

                                    The Venin Otaota are enigmatic and feared, their very essence infused with toxic sap
                                    that flows like venom through their veins.
                                    Venin are the unseen protectors of the Otaota, often acting from the shadows to
                                    safeguard their people. Their sap, while deadly to foes,
                                    is sacred to their kind, symbolizing both the power of life and the inevitability of
                                    decay.

                                    Venin Otaota are typically found in the darker, wetter corners of their lands, such
                                    as
                                    marshes, dense jungles, or shadowed groves.
                                    They act as guardians of these sacred spaces, where their poisonous nature is most
                                    effective. Their ability to commune with and command
                                    other plant life is revered within Otaota culture, as they can summon dense thickets
                                    or
                                    poisonous vines to entrap enemies or bolster defenses.

                                    and roots that metaphorically run deep into the earth, they are the embodiment of
                                    stability and protection. Husk Otaota are often the first

                                    In the deep, dark forests of the realm, a strange and ancient species of mushroom
                                    has
                                    come to prominence.
                                    These sentient beings, known as the Fungi, have evolved over millennia to possess
                                    intelligence and will of their own.
                                    They are capable of communicating with one another through a complex system of
                                    spores
                                    and chemicals, and possess a
                                    deep understanding of the natural world around them. Some Fungi have even learned to
                                    harness the power of magic,
                                    using their unique physiology to cast powerful spells and curses. Though they are
                                    often
                                    feared and misunderstood by
                                    the other races of the realm, the Fungi are a vital part of the ecosystem, and play
                                    a
                                    crucial role in maintaining the
                                    balance of nature.

                                    Fungi come in many variations, from the small, psychedelic mushrooms that are used
                                    by
                                    the local tribes for religious rituals,

                                    to wander too close. Each species
                                    of Fungi has its own unique abilities and characteristics, making them a fascinating

                                    be
                                    mistaken for edible mushrooms by foragers.

                    <h3>Symbiotes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Symbiotes are an enigmatic and ancient species known for their unique ability to form
                        powerful bonds with various hosts.
                        They can be found in the darkest corners and most sacred spaces of the world, attracted
                        to beings with strong capabilities
                        and unique traits. They enhance their host's abilities while deriving sustenance and
                        other benefits from the bond. These
                        extraordinary creatures exist in various forms, such as the aggressive Parasitic
                        Symbiotes and the wise Eternal Worms.
                        Each symbiote offers a distinct set of skills and enhancements, making them highly
                        sought-after companions for those who
                        can handle the challenges and responsibilities of hosting such powerful beings. Their
                        bonds with their hosts create a
                        profound and life-changing connection, forever altering the destinies of both parties
                        involved.

                        <h4>Symbiote Removal</h4>
                        <p>
                            Removing a symbiote is a dangerous and delicate process. A successful Medicine check
                            is
                            required to safely remove the symbiote
                            without causing harm to the host or the symbiote. If the check fails, the host and
                            symbiote each take damage and may suffer
                            from various conditions or penalties.

                        <h4>Being Without a Host</h4>
                        <p>
                            Symbiotes can survive outside of a host for a number of hours equal to their
                            Survival

                            otherwise suitable host within that time, they immediately take the Death condition.

                                            To bond, the symbiote must succeed on an Influence Check to convince
                                            the host of the mutual benefits of
                                            their relationship. Once bonded, the symbiote grants the host the

                                        <li><strong>Devourer:</strong> A host bonded through Devourer lasts for

                                            To bond, the symbiote must win a contested Strength Check to
                                            forcibly overtake the host's body. On a failure,
                                            the host is immune to the Devourer while alive. Once bonded, the
                                            symbiote enhances the host’s combat
                                            capabilities, granting +1 to melee attack checks and damage.
                                            Additionally, the host gains the ability to heal
                                            themselves as an action for [[6 Healing]] or remove one Corpus
                                            Condition as an action, usable once per long rest.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Passenger:</strong> A host bonded through Passenger lasts
                                            indefinitely, as the symbiote thrives
                                            in secrecy without overtly harming the host. To bond, the symbiote
                                            must succeed on a Stealth Check to
                                            infiltrate the host’s body without their knowledge. Once bonded, the
                                            Passenger can, as an action, grant the
                                            host Invisibility until the end of their next turn or until they
                                            take an aggressive action. This bond allows
                                            the Passenger to act as a silent companion, leveraging the host’s
                                            body for its own goals while avoiding detection.</li>

                            Eternal Worms are a wise and ancient species of symbiote that have lived for
                            centuries within various hosts. They are
                            found in the sacred groves and ancient ruins where the barriers between the planes
                            are thin. They have the ability to
                            transfer their memories and experiences to their host, allowing them to benefit from
                            a wealth of knowledge and skills,
                            and even the ability to access ancient and forgotten magic.

                                wing appendages. Their skin tones range from deep, earthy shades to darker hues

                                sheen under direct light, reflecting their resilient nature and powerful gifts.
                                Firstborn can use their tendrils for
                                various tasks, offering them unique interaction possibilities with the

                                    In the spectral hierarchy of strigoi, the Tristeţe are the outcasts, the forsaken.
                                    Their name, translating to 'sadness',
                                    poignantly mirrors their existence. These unfortunate vampires, transformed into
                                    lesser beings by disease, foul magic, or
                                    tragic incidents, bear grotesque deformities. Their skin, weak and light-sensitive,
                                    compels them to lurk in the shadows, away
                                    from the sun's harsh judgment and society's scorn. Immortal, their existence is an
                                    endless nocturnal cycle.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Shunned and often slain on sight, the Tristeţe survive by adopting disguises, their
                                    true forms concealed beneath layers of
                                    illusion. Despite their tragic circumstances, they outnumber their nobler
                                    counterparts, their prevalence a harsh testament
                                    to the vampire world's realities. Their deformed bodies, grotesquely resilient, can
                                    regenerate wounds unless exposed to
                                    sunlight or holy water. However, their light sensitivity is a severe weakness, with
                                    the sun's rays inflicting wounds that
                                    their bodies labor to heal. Holy symbols and radiant damage are particularly
                                    harmful, their unholy nature rendering them
                                    vulnerable to such forces.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Tristeţe embody the vampire legend's darker side, a stark contrast to the
                                    nobility and allure often associated with
                                    their kind. They are the forsaken, the deformed, the sorrowful, their existence a
                                    haunting reminder of the tragic
                                    possibilities lurking in the vampire world's shadows.

                                    In the shadowy realm of the undead, the Avuţie stand as the epitome of vampire
                                    nobility. They are the embodiment of the timeless
                                    allure and chilling dread that has become synonymous with the vampire legend. The
                                    Avuţie are not mere predators of the night,
                                    but sophisticated rulers who have held the reins of power for centuries. They have
                                    been kings and queens, lords and ladies,
                                    their rule extending over vast lands shrouded in fear and mystery. Their wealth is
                                    as ancient as they are, accrued over
                                    countless lifetimes, a testament to their cunning and influence. Despite their
                                    elegance and charm, the Avuţie are a chilling
                                    reminder of the true nature of the strigoi. They are as dangerous as they are
                                    alluring, their wealth and influence making
                                    them a formidable force in the world of the undead.

                                    The Tărie, the embodiment of raw, unyielding strength, are a formidable sight to
                                    behold. These Dravin-kin are the epitome of
                                    physical prowess among the strigoi, their bodies honed to perfection through
                                    centuries of relentless training and battle. Their
                                    skin, ashen and cold, is a stark contrast to the vibrant crimson of the blood that
                                    sustains them. Their eyes, a piercing silver,
                                    radiate an intimidating presence, a clear warning to any who dare to cross their
                                    path.

                                    Their wings, massive and powerful, are not just for show. They are fully functional,
                                    capable of carrying the Tărie into the sky.
                                    But these wings serve another purpose. They are strong and dexterous enough to wield
                                    additional simple melee weapons, turning the
                                    Tărie into a whirlwind of steel and fury on the battlefield. This unique ability
                                    allows them to engage multiple enemies at once.

                                    The Înviere are a haunting testament to the power of the undying, a species born
                                    from failed resurrections and ancient, mystical
                                    connections. Their existence is a paradox, caught between life and death, yet
                                    belonging to neither. They are the children of the
                                    Undying King and the Lord of Winter, Kharn, embodying the chilling touch of death
                                    and the relentless endurance of the cold.

                                    unique tapestry of life's end and its defiance.
                                    Their eyes glow with an eerie light, a beacon in the darkness they navigate so well.
                                    They move with purpose and intent, their
                                    actions driven by inscrutable goals known only to them and their undying deities.

                                    they once lived. They bear the visage of their

                                    lightest alabaster to the deepest ebony. Their
                                    bodies are often marked by the circumstances of their death, with scars, wounds, and
                                    other signs of their mortal end etched permanently

                            Zoanthropes, also known as shifters or half-men, are a unique species of creatures
                            that possess both human
                            and animal traits. They are neither wholly human nor wholly animal, placing them
                            outside of society's norms
                            and conventions. They have the ability to shift between human and animal forms, a
                            skill that sets them apart
                            and makes them both fascinating and feared. Known for their strong connections to
                            the natural world, they
                            possess heightened senses, strength, and agility. While revered by some cultures as
                            protectors of the natural
                            world, they are often ostracized and discriminated against, seen as freaks and
                            outsiders. They frequently form
                            tight-knit communities where they can find acceptance among their own kind.

                                        These shifters possess a strong predatory heritage and are characterized by
                                        their sharp claws and powerful jaws.
                                        They are skilled hunters, often preying on meat to sustain themselves. Rarely
                                        found in cities, they prefer a tribal
                                        lifestyle where they can hunt and roam freely. Fierce and powerful, they are
                                        often seen as protectors of their tribe.

                                        These half-men have evolved to possess avian characteristics, with the ability
                                        to shift into a full bird form. Agile
                                        and quick, they can fly and soar with the grace of a bird. Often found near
                                        communities of avian beastfolk, they are
                                        considered a mutation of the humanoid/lycanthrope. Known for their strong sense

                                        intelligent and adaptable.

                                        These shifters possess a strong aquatic heritage, characterized by their ability
                                        to shift into a full aquatic form
                                        such as fish or marine mammals. Equipped with powerful fins, gills, and webbed
                                        extremities, they excel in
                                        underwater environments. With heightened senses underwater and the ability to
                                        communicate with aquatic
                                        creatures, they are considered protectors of the ocean and its inhabitants.
                                        Often found near coastal or aquatic
                                        communities, they are known for their peaceful and loyal nature.

                                        The Satyrs are a mystical and mischievous breed of shifters, deeply tied to the
                                        feywild and the untamed forces
                                        of nature. Often mistaken for beastmen, Satyrs possess a unique blend of
                                        humanoid intelligence and feral
                                        instinct. With goat-like features such as cloven hooves, small horns, and nimble
                                        frames, their true essence lies
                                        in their connection to the fey.

                                    <p>
                                        Natural performers and instigators, Satyrs thrive in chaos and revelry, wielding
                                        haunting melodies and
                                        captivating charm to influence others. Despite their playful demeanor, they are
                                        fiercely protective of their kin
                                        and the wilds they call home. Often found in ancient groves or hidden fey
                                        crossings, they act as guardians and
                                        emissaries of their enigmatic fey ancestry.

                                        determination of their humanoid form. Known as tireless hunters and warriors,
                                        they roam the expansive
                                        grasslands and plains they call home. Centaur society revolves around freedom

                            harsh conditions. Among these

                                    Scorpikin, also known as Aqrabuamelu in their native tongue, are fierce
                                    and formidable shifters. Created
                                    by the dragon goddess Tiamat to wage war against her rivals, these
                                    half-human, half-scorpion beings have
                                    since gained independence. Now residing in the Red Desert, they live
                                    under the rule of the powerful
                                    insect-like Scarab Lords. With their human upper body and scorpion lower
                                    half, Scorpikin possess immense
                                    strength, agility, and an additional pair of pincers that can hold
                                    objects or be used as weapons. Known
                                    for their fierce loyalty and combat prowess, Scorpikin are a force to be
                                    reckoned with on the battlefield.

                                Spiderkin are a unique species of humanoids characterized by their lean,
                                thickly haired bodies and large
                                mandibles. Their mandibles make speaking the common tongue difficult, yet
                                they have adapted to communicate
                                effectively. Females of the species are known for their powerful builds and
                                combat abilities, while males
                                are agile and often skilled in magic. Fiercely loyal to their tribes, they
                                are commonly found in wooded or
                                mountainous regions where they spin webs for hunting and protection. Many
                                Spiderkin have found work in
                                libraries, weaving intricate web systems to categorize and organize
                                knowledge.

                                Tikkin are a small, elusive species known for their need to survive on
                                blood. With small statures and sharp fangs,
                                they feed on the blood of other creatures. Despite their unique dietary
                                requirements, Tikkin are not inherently
                                violent, often finding non-harmful methods to sustain themselves. However,
                                their nature leads to societal rejection,
                                forcing them to live in the shadows. Fiercely protective of their
                                communities, Tikkin have developed a strong sense

                            Avians are a diverse species of beastmen whose feathered forms and flight abilities
                            connect them to the skies.
                            Adapted to various climates and cultures across the world, they range from proud
                            hawk-like warriors to peaceful
                            dove-like diplomats, each embodying unique avian traits. Their cities, suspended
                            among the clouds or perched atop
                            towering peaks, are marvels of architecture, blending natural beauty with
                            engineering precision. These skybound
                            civilizations are steeped in ancient feathered traditions, including the sacred
                            "Molting Ceremony," where feathers
                            lost in combat or hardship are ritually honored as symbols of resilience.

                            Avians are natural navigators, known for their ability to traverse great distances
                            with ease, making them revered
                            messengers and scouts. While fiercely protective of their aerial territories, Avians
                            often serve as bridges between
                            grounded civilizations, bringing knowledge, trade, and diplomacy from one land to
                            another. Their language, Naech
                            (or Trill), is a melodic combination of chirps, whistles, and harmonics that echoes
                            their heritage. As guardians of
                            the skies and keepers of the winds, Avians hold their ancient traditions as dearly
                            as they do their freedom, soaring
                            through history as symbols of unity and wisdom.

                                        Corvus are a unique avian subspecies born under the patronage of the gods Huginn
                                        and Muninn. Those born under
                                        Huginn are intelligent crows, while those under Muninn are ravens cursed by a
                                        fey deity with perfect memory,
                                        though they can only speak in mimicry if they choose to. This duality of
                                        intelligence and memory has led them to
                                        thrive in roles as court reporters, spies, and stage performers. Often found in
                                        cities, Corvus use their talents
                                        to gather information, navigate social hierarchies, and make a living. Skilled

                                        The Hawk humanoids, also known as Avian Knights, are a proud and honorable
                                        species. Their bodies are covered in
                                        feathers, with wings that allow short flights or gliding over long distances.
                                        Their sharp talons, combined with their
                                        strength and agility, make them exceptional hunters and warriors. Hawks are
                                        organized in a feudal system, where each
                                        territory has its own lord responsible for the safety and well-being of their
                                        people.

                                        The Avian Knights, as the most powerful members of their society, serve as the
                                        lord’s personal protectors and military
                                        leaders. Known for their bravery, loyalty, and commitment to justice, they
                                        dedicate their lives to training and
                                        discipline to become the best warriors. Fiercely independent but compassionate,
                                        Hawks symbolize hope and are revered
                                        as defenders of the weak. Whether in the air or on the ground, they are a force
                                        to be reckoned with, embodying the
                                        virtues of strength, courage, and nobility.

                                    <p>
                                        Penguins are a unique subspecies of avian beastmen, adapted to life in cold
                                        coastal regions and the open ocean.
                                        Though flightless, they are exceptional swimmers and agile divers, capable of
                                        navigating icy waters with unmatched
                                        grace. Known for their tightly-knit communities, they build intricate ice
                                        villages along glacial coasts, fortified
                                        against the harsh elements. Penguins hold deep cultural reverence for the
                                        "Eternal Ice," an ancient tradition
                                        celebrating resilience, teamwork, and the bond between the sea and the sky.
                                        These ceremonies involve synchronized
                                        dances and storytelling by elder penguins, recounting legendary migrations and
                                        ocean spirits.

                                        Penguins have strong protective instincts, working cooperatively to guard their
                                        homes from predators and environmental
                                        dangers. Their natural resilience and physical adaptations make them excellent

                                        invaluable allies in both the sea and icy terrains. Despite their smaller
                                        stature and inability to fly, penguins
                                        exemplify determination, resourcefulness, and a profound connection to the
                                        ocean's mysteries.

                                        Phoenixes are rare, mystical avians connected to fire and renewal. Known for
                                        their blazing feathers and the ability to
                                        rise from their ashes, they are symbols of hope and perseverance. Phoenix
                                        societies focus on the cycles of life, death,
                                        and rebirth, with sacred pyres serving as places of renewal and meditation.
                                        Their fiery presence and ability to endure
                                        make them a beacon of resilience and inspiration.

                        <h3>Beruklians</h3>
                        <p>
                            Beruklians are a unique and advanced species of ape humanoids that originated from
                            various tropical islands around
                            the world. They have unified on the island of Beruklian, where they have developed a
                            highly organized and hierarchical
                            society. Due to the island's dense population, towering high-rise structures have
                            been constructed to house their
                            vibrant culture. The city is a bustling hub of trade, commerce, and education, with
                            a deep respect for hierarchy and
                            order reflected in every aspect of their society. Even when Beruklians leave the
                            island, they maintain their strong
                            sense of social hierarchy and order, making them a fascinating species to observe.

                                        domesticate or control, Papios are highly intelligent and adaptable, thriving in
                                        diverse environments. They also
                                        possess a complex social structure and communication system, allowing them to
                                        work effectively in groups despite
                                        their fearsome reputation.

                        <p>
                            The Lupine (Alpha) subspecies are proud and noble leaders, known for their fierce
                            loyalty and exceptional hunting

                                        The Lupine (Alpha) subspecies are proud, fiercely loyal leaders, easily
                                        recognized by their striking coats of pure
                                        white or jet black—a mark of their lineage, said to descend from Fenris
                                        themself. Their heritage ties them to
                                        ancient tales of bravery and ferocity, with some Alphas claiming to carry
                                        Fenris’s wild spirit within them. Alphas
                                        are natural-born leaders, often serving as pack heads, tribal chiefs, or war
                                        commanders. While their hot-headed
                                        nature can lead to brash decisions, their determination and unwavering loyalty
                                        inspire those who follow them.

                                        In the wild, Alphas are exceptional hunters, using their keen senses to track
                                        prey and enemies alike. Their booming
                                        howls, resonant and commanding, rally their allies and strike fear into foes.
                                        Despite their impulsive tendencies,
                                        Alphas hold a deep responsibility for their pack’s well-being, often putting
                                        themselves at risk to protect their
                                        kin. They embody both the strength and flaws of their legendary ancestor.

                                        The nomadic Coyotes are the wandering storytellers and resilient survivalists of
                                        the Caniform species. Often traveling
                                        in small groups or as lone adventurers, they are known for their sharp tongues
                                        and clever antics. Coyotes thrive in open
                                        plains, deserts, and scrublands, where they use their humor and guile to outwit

                                        Hellhorn culture values strength and dominance, with ceremonial duels and

                                        Some Hellhorns seek redemption, striving to break free from their dark heritage,
                                        while others fully embrace it, using
                                        their infernal resilience to dominate enemies and defend their lands.

                                        The Labyrinthine Minotaurs are ancient guardians, revered for their unparalleled

                                        protectors of sacred mazes. Their fur often bears intricate, natural patterns
                                        resembling mazes, and their towering
                                        frames exude both mystery and wisdom. Originating as wardens of ancient
                                        dungeons, they are now invaluable guides in
                                        modern cities, where their ability to never lose their way makes them adept

                                        Labyrinthine Minotaur culture is steeped in traditions of service and
                                        protection, with rites of passage that involve
                                        defending or solving labyrinths. To these Minotaurs, mazes are sacred spaces
                                        connecting them to their ancestors and
                                        their duty. Despite their intimidating presence, Labyrinthine Minotaurs are

                            of community, often establishing territories where they live and work together in
                            harmony. Their society is deeply
                            rooted in loyalty and kinship, with every member contributing to the wellbeing of
                            the whole.

                        <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                        <p>
                            Felidae typically stand between 4-7 ft tall, with slender, muscular bodies and a
                            wide range of fur colors and patterns,
                            including stripes, spots, and solid colors. Their faces resemble those of large
                            cats, with pointed ears, sharp teeth,
                            and distinctive whiskers. They have large, expressive eyes, well-adapted for
                            low-light vision, and their overall
                            appearance exudes both grace and strength.

                        <h4>Culture</h4>
                        <p>
                            Felidae culture is steeped in tradition and a deep connection with the natural
                            world. They have a profound respect for
                            nature's balance and often live in harmony with their surroundings. Skilled hunters
                            and trackers, they rely on their
                            innate abilities to stalk and catch prey. Additionally, Felidae have a strong
                            affinity for music and storytelling,
                            with folklore passed down through generations in the form of songs and tales.

                        <h4>Social Structure</h4>
                        <p>
                            Felidae society is divided into close-knit communities called prides, usually led by
                            a dominant individual or a small
                            group of leaders. These prides consist of families and friends who work together to
                            protect their territory and meet
                            the group's needs. Felidae are fiercely loyal to their pride and will go to great
                            lengths to defend it from external
                            threats.

                                        craftsmanship, with their ships doubling as
                                        floating galleries of intricate carvings and vibrant colors. Once rulers of

                                        The Kivuli, or Panthari, are enigmatic and elusive Felidae, often called the
                                        "Shadows of the Jungle." Living in dense
                                        forests or hidden enclaves, they are masters of stealth and ambush tactics.
                                        Their black or darkly patterned fur allows
                                        them to blend seamlessly with their surroundings, making them nearly invisible
                                        in low light. Kivuli culture revolves
                                        around safeguarding ancient knowledge and defending sacred jungle sites. While
                                        they prefer to remain unseen, their
                                        swift and precise strikes leave an unforgettable mark on those who threaten
                                        their home.

                                        Their society values cunning over brute strength, with elders teaching younger

                                        observation, and precision. Kivuli legends speak of "Night Stalkers," legendary
                                        warriors who once protected entire
                                        regions with unmatched stealth and agility.

                                        The Mwendokasi, or Cheetari, are the fastest of all Felidae, known for their
                                        unmatched speed and agility. Found in open
                                        savannahs or expansive grasslands, their slim, muscular builds allow them to
                                        outrun nearly any predator—or prey.
                                        Mwendokasi are revered as messengers, scouts, and first responders in times of
                                        conflict, carrying vital information

                                        endurance trials are key traditions, showcasing their speed as an offering to

                                        Known for their love of rivers and
                                        marshlands, they are natural swimmers and builders, often constructing homes
                                        along waterways. Hippokin are revered
                                        for their intellect and ingenuity, focusing on crafting, invention, and the
                                        exchange of ideas. Their communities serve
                                        as hubs for trade and knowledge, enriching their regions with innovation.

                                        Hippokin take pride in their calm and measured demeanor, often acting as
                                        mediators and problem-solvers. However, when
                                        roused to action, their immense strength and nearly impenetrable hide make them
                                        formidable opponents. Hippokin warriors
                                        are known for using water as a tactical advantage, drawing enemies into terrain
                                        they control.

                            and unrelenting curiosity. These

                            to their surroundings. Though often underestimated due to their size, their

                            quick speech and fast-paced lives
                            often leave larger creatures struggling to keep up. Yet, for all their restlessness,
                            Gliers form deep bonds with those
                            they trust, standing by their allies with fierce loyalty. Whether crafting gadgets,
                            hoarding treasures, or exploring

                                        Molefolk are subterranean Gliers with strong, clawed hands designed for digging.
                                        Thriving underground, they excavate
                                        vast tunnel systems for their homes and communities. Resourceful and resilient,
                                        Molefolk are perfectly adapted to life
                                        in dark and confined spaces.

                            Reptilia typically stand between 5-7 ft tall, with bodies covered in tough, scaly
                            skin that comes in a variety of
                            colors and patterns. They have elongated, lizard-like heads with sharp teeth and
                            slit-like eyes. Some Reptilia have
                            tails, while others possess frills, crests, or spines along their bodies. Their
                            limbs are strong and muscular, with

                            Reptilia communities are often found in warm climates such as deserts, jungles, and
                            swamps, where they bask in the sun
                            to regulate their body temperatures. They have a strong connection to the natural

                                        The She-Ren are a race of snake-like humanoids who see the human form as
                                        something that can always be improved. Their
                                        bodies are a blend of human and snake features, with some individuals having
                                        snake-like lower halves they use to
                                        constrict enemies. They often adorn themselves with jewelry, tattoos, and
                                        undergo magical or mechanical augmentations
                                        to enhance their abilities. Known for their venomous bites or powerful
                                        constriction abilities, She-Ren are both
                                        dangerous foes and valued allies.

                        them boons in exchange for their devotion to Yeeshnu.

                    <p>
                        Members of the Trinity are outcasts in civilized lands, often killed on sight due to the
                        diseases they carry and the
                        fear they inspire. Playing as a member of the Trinity is a unique challenge, as their
                        presence will be met with caution
                        and distrust, even from allies.

                        <p>
                            Gnolls are a powerful and imposing species, born from the hyena lord Yeeshnu.
                            Known for their brute strength and
                            ferocity in battle, gnolls often lead bands of Scourge and Vulturkin, using
                            their physical dominance to
                            intimidate and control. Fiercely loyal to their clans, gnolls have a strong pack
                            mentality and will fiercely
                            defend their kin and territory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gnolls are carnivorous, known to hunt and devour their prey whole. Their
                            intimidating presence and unyielding
                            loyalty to their god Yeeshnu make them both fearsome enemies and controversial
                            allies.

                            Also known as the Sky Plague, the Scavengers are mystic beings born from the
                            plague. They are deeply connected to death
                            and the afterlife, often serving as spiritual leaders and guides for their
                            fellow Gnolls and Scourge. Known for their
                            elaborate burial rituals and ceremonies, they maintain a strong sense of
                            community and tradition.

                            Scavengers are carrion eaters, relying on their powerful beaks and talons to

                            ominous reputation, they are valued for their spiritual insights and their
                            ability to commune with the spirits of the
                            dead.

                            their place in the world.
                            Species bring their individuality to the forefront, creating an infinite variety of stories

                    <p>Humans are a rare but influential creatures, known for their leadership within the

                        Over time, "human" has broadened to include other humanoids, yet "true humans" hold a
                        distinct
                        status, marked by their uncommon appearance and significant roles. Encountering a human

                        casual
                        settings, away from their typical authoritative contexts, can be surprising and leads to
                        whispered
                        speculations. This duality of reverence and suspicion underscores the complex legacy of

                                    supernatural
                                    origins and extraordinary abilities. They are the result of ancient interference
                                    by
                                    fey,
                                    fiendish, or otherworldly beings, who swapped their progeny with human children.
                                    This
                                    heritage ties them deeply to chaotic realms, giving them the unique ability to
                                    alter
                                    their
                                    physical appearance.

                                    Changelings have a strange and fascinating presence in the world. Their ability
                                    to
                                    shift
                                    their form allows them to adapt to almost any situation, but it also alienates
                                    them
                                    from
                                    others. This power often leads to them being both feared and sought after, with
                                    some
                                    becoming spies, diplomats, or performers, while others are wrongly associated
                                    with
                                    criminal
                                    or deceitful activities.

                                            Changelings are quiet imposters. They are creatures that replace themselves
                                            in the life of someone else. While the old stories speak of fey mischief and
                                            forest spirits, most changelings don't know where they came from. They are
                                            almost human: their voice slightly wrong, their smile too still, their
                                            movements rehearsed. Found in villages, orphanages, or city gutters, they
                                            blend into society until someone looks too closely. Raised in place of the
                                            real child, they often become wanderers or con artists, driven by a subtle
                                            sense of displacement. Some seek truth. Others play the role they were
                                            given. Many are hunted by those who believe the switch can be undone.

                                    Dwarves thrive in diverse environments both above and below ground. They are

                                    Historically, Dwarves were integral members of a larger empire that united many
                                    species
                                    groups. However, they broke away following a dispute between their ruler, the
                                    Tyrant
                                    King,
                                    and the Emperor of the empire. This pivotal split shaped Dwarven culture,
                                    fostering
                                    an

                                    around craftsmanship, trade, and a rigid adherence to tradition. Despite their

                                    toward self-sufficiency, Dwarves are far from isolationist. Their goods and

                                            traditionalists. They've instituted a system where many creatures find
                                            themselves bound in a form of indentured servitude. These individuals are
                                            obligated to serve until they've completed their education and repaid all
                                            debts. This practice, while ensuring a steady workforce for the Breaker
                                            dwarves, has earned them a reputation of being master manipulators and
                                            oppressors. While many view the Breaker dwarves as malevolent due to their

                                            Their pale complexion is often offset by hair shades ranging from rich
                                            bronze to fiery red. The red tattoos adorning their bodies are not mere
                                            decorations; they are symbols of status, experience, and in many cases,
                                            allegiance to the Tyrant Lord.

                                    Elves are a deeply adaptive group of species who evolve and adapt to their

                                    so
                                    thoroughly that they often become integral parts of the ecosystems they inhabit.

                                    their grace, long lives, and connection to magic, Elves are a common thread in

                                    of many species, having played pivotal roles in the histories of others.

                                    <p>Long ago, the ancestors of the Breaker Elves sought refuge in the underground
                                        realms to escape a cataclysmic event on the surface. Over the centuries, their
                                        physiology adapted to the darkness, resulting in the evolution of their
                                        distinctive skin tone and hair. Born in the depths and bred for endurance,
                                        Breaker Elves are not delicate or free. They were shaped by centuries of
                                        indentured servitude beneath the breaker dwarves, pressed into labor, pit
                                        fighting, and enforcement. Over time, their bodies adapted, becoming bulkier
                                        than surface kin, their skin bears hues of mauve, clay red, and bruised pinks,
                                        blending with rusted stone and torchlight. Their hair, always blood-red, is
                                        braided or shorn tight for utility, not beauty. Their eyes are adapted to see in
                                        the infrared spectrum, allowing them to perceive temperature differences in
                                        their environment, which can be especially handy in detecting living beings or

                                    <p>Duskwither Elves thrive where others falter, in deep caves, shadowed forests, and
                                        forgotten fungal groves. Their bodies, often pale or patterned with living
                                        lichen, are shaped by symbiosis with the shadowy world around them. Some grow
                                        bioluminescent spores along their shoulders. Others have spider-silk white hair
                                        and eyes that shimmer in dim light. They walk quietly, feel vibrations beneath
                                        their bare feet, and hear the whispers of the spore networks like ancient radio
                                        signals. Among themselves, they speak in soft tones or not at all, often
                                        communicating through motion, spores, or shared silences. Outsiders find them
                                        eerie, but those who earn their trust discover a community bound by empathy,
                                        instinct, and ancestral memory.

                                        between worlds. Their smoky, ethereal appearance reflects the nature of their
                                        homeland, where light and darkness intertwine. These elves are natural wanderers
                                        between dimensions, often acting as guides, spies, or guardians of planar
                                        boundaries. Their connection to shadow and their ability to move unseen make
                                        them mysterious figures in the eyes of other species groups. Despite their
                                        otherworldly demeanor, Shadow Elves are deeply thoughtful and often wrestle with
                                        the duality of their existence.

                                    <p>Also known as High Elves, Noble Elves pride themselves on their mastery of magic
                                        and their long-standing heritage as rulers and scholars. They once formed grand
                                        kingdoms in the Feywild, their courts steeped in arcane tradition and timeless
                                        beauty. Though many remain in the Feywild, some Noble Elves have returned to the

                                        Noble Elves are graceful and regal, often exuding an air of superiority, but
                                        their intellect and magical prowess make them valuable allies.

                                    Gnomes are an inventive and endlessly curious group of species, known for their
                                    boundless
                                    imagination and the risks they often take in pursuit of knowledge. Once thriving
                                    in
                                    the
                                    Feywild, Gnomes were celebrated for their ingenuity and eccentricity. However,
                                    their
                                    curiosity took a dark turn with the rise of the Tinker Gnomes, who, in their
                                    pursuit
                                    of
                                    magical power, began harvesting dryad hearts to create cores for powerful
                                    constructs.

                                    When the atrocities came to light, the Feywild itself, under the guidance of
                                    Mother
                                    Nature,
                                    banished all Gnomes, marking them as exiles. Though the actions of the Tinker
                                    Gnomes
                                    were
                                    the cause, the punishment extended to the entire Gnomish people, forcing them to
                                    leave
                                    their
                                    home plane forever. This banishment left a deep mark on Gnomish culture,
                                    splitting
                                    them

                                    and

                                    Despite their complicated past, Gnomes are fiercely determined to make their
                                    mark on
                                    the
                                    world. They are often seen as visionaries, tinkering with magical devices,
                                    crafting
                                    intricate machinery, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. While many
                                    Gnomes
                                    resent the mistakes of their ancestors, others see their exile as a challenge to
                                    prove
                                    that
                                    their ingenuity can benefit the world without repeating the sins of the past.

                                    <p> Hearthless Gnomes are wanderers who no longer seek belonging. Once part of the
                                        vibrant Feywild, something in them faded long ago. Now, they drift from place to
                                        place, setting up pockets of comfort in ruined homes, dead forests, and
                                        forgotten tunnels. They are soft-spoken and strangely serene, often tending to
                                        others without emotion or judgment. They don’t protect because it’s right. They
                                        do it because it’s what they do. Their presence quiets the mind, dulls fear, and
                                        warms the bones, even if nothing behind their eyes reflects it. Wherever they
                                        stop feels like home… but only while they’re there.

                                <h3>Kleinkind</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Small in stature but grand in spirit, the Kleinkind are a species as cozy as a
                                    well-worn
                                    quilt and as surprising as a jack-in-the-box. Often referred to as "Halflings"
                                    by
                                    outsiders,
                                    these delightful people weave a narrative claiming they were the first
                                    intelligent
                                    beings to
                                    grace the planet. Whether this is true or just a tale spun over a warm mug of
                                    cider,
                                    the
                                    Kleinkind hold their belief with pride (and no small amount of charm).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Kleinkind's hallmark is their love of community and comfort. Their villages
                                    are
                                    havens
                                    of merriment, where doors are always open, feasts are abundant, and every
                                    stranger
                                    is a
                                    friend waiting to be made. Their lives are painted with warmth and laughter,
                                    their
                                    hearths
                                    glowing as brightly as their spirits. But not all Kleinkind are content to stay
                                    within
                                    the
                                    snug borders of their idyllic enclaves. Some feel the pull of the road, a

                                    that
                                    drives them to become Barnstormers—restless travelers who bring joy, stories,
                                    and
                                    just a
                                    touch of chaos wherever they go.

                                    Physically, Kleinkind are marvels of density. Standing no taller than 2 feet,
                                    they
                                    are
                                    far
                                    heavier than their size suggests, with compact musculature that makes them
                                    unexpectedly
                                    sturdy. A 1-foot Kleinkind can weigh up to 60 pounds, leading to many a startled
                                    adventurer
                                    who underestimated their strength. Despite their heft, they move with surprising
                                    nimbleness,
                                    like a stone rolling downhill—steady and unstoppable.

                                            born became Maldios, a war-driven soul who descended into the burning depths

                                            ash, he rose not just as a survivor, but as a conqueror. Now known as a
                                            greater demon of war, Maldios stands over twenty feet tall, his wings
                                            scorched and leathery, his armor built from the bones of Rotalisks;
                                            terrifying creatures that devour demons. Maldios is wrath embodied, a being
                                            of perfect violence and control.

                                            glisten with an internal fire that never dims. They are not savages however,

                                            reef-spined coastlines of the world. Their skin ranges from deep slate to
                                            sea-glass green, often mottled with barnacle-like textures or salt-etched
                                            markings. Their long limbs, powerful lungs, and strong backs make them

                                <p>Known as Core Bound or The Forged, these entities were originally crafted by gnome
                                    tinkerers who transferred dryads from their natural habitats into engineered cores.
                                    This fusion of natural essence and mechanical engineering gave rise to sentient
                                    beings encased in armor, powered by the very core of nature itself. While they were
                                    initially used in warfare due to their ability to be reborn in new armors if the
                                    core remained intact, modern Core Bound constructs lead full lives, capable of all
                                    human-like functions including emotional connections. Efforts continue among
                                    scholars to unlock and reclaim memories from the cores that might still linger from
                                    previous incarnations.

                            the primordial forces of the elements.
                            Tracing their lineage back to the dawn of existence, the Ensuri embody the fierce
                            power and untamed beauty of the natural world.
                            Some among them hail from ancient families, their bloodlines intertwined with
                            elemental spirits through sacred rites and ancient pacts.
                            Others are the product of transformation, individuals who were altered by profound
                            elemental events, forever changed by their exposure to raw elemental power.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With appearances as diverse as the elements themselves, the Ensuri possess traits
                            reflective of their elemental heritage—skin that shimmers like the surface
                            of a lake under moonlight for those of water lineage, or eyes that flicker with the
                            undying flame of their fire ancestors. They are beings of both creation
                            and destruction, capable of wielding their elemental powers with a natural ease that
                            belies their human origins.

                                    carry them. With their airy conversations and light-hearted demeanor,

                                    Often misunderstood and feared, the Toxic Ensuri thrive in the shadows of
                                    society. Their toxic clouds are both their defense and their curse, driving
                                    them to live in swamps and sewers.
                                    Despite this, they have a rich culture of resilience and survival. They are
                                    adept at alchemy and herbalism, creating potent remedies and poisons. Their
                                    homes are often hidden and fortified,
                                    making use of natural camouflage. Their diet includes strong-flavored and
                                    fermented foods, symbolizing their ability to thrive in harsh conditions and
                                    turn adversity into strength.

                                    The Water Ensuri are fluid and adaptable, with a serene and calming
                                    presence. Their semi-translucent skin shimmers like the surface of a clear
                                    lake. They live in harmony with the aquatic world,
                                    often residing in underwater cities made of coral and glass. Their culture
                                    revolves around the ebb and flow of the tides, with ceremonies and
                                    traditions tied to the lunar cycles.
                                    They enjoy seafood and freshwater plants, with meals that are light and
                                    refreshing, such as ceviche and sushi, mirroring the coastal cuisine and
                                    their connection to the ocean's tranquility.

                        <p>
                            Helborn are not demons. They are the living descendants or echoes of twisted souls
                            that failed their passage through the Ordealis. Their souls remain mortal. They can
                            still choose kindness, loyalty, and love. But something within them carries the burn
                            of what could have gone wrong.The Ordealis is not a place of punishment. It is a
                            proving ground where the soul passes through nine trials in pursuit of celestial
                            clarity. Most pass in time. Some are reshaped. A few are shattered. These failures
                            become demons. The Helborn are the consequence of those failures leaving a mark
                            behind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some are born this way, the result of a bloodline touched by corruption generations
                            ago. Others are made by accident or force. A failed summoning. An alchemical
                            experiment gone wrong. The slow erosion of identity during possession. All lead to
                            the same outcome. A mortal with something infernal settled deep in their spirit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each Helborn carries a trace of one of the nine layers of the Ordealis. The Desolate
                            breeds Helborn who are hollow with loneliness, constantly surrounding themselves
                            with families or large communities to drown out the silence. Inkshadow gives rise to
                            knowledge-starved wanderers who fear their own intelligence and avoid books because
                            of the addiction they trigger. Other layers leave different scars. Each is distinct.
                            Each carries a lesson the soul could not learn in time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite their shared nature, Helborn rarely trust one another. Those from different
                            layers are treated with suspicion or outright contempt. Their pain is too personal.
                            Their burdens are not alike. But when a Helborn meets a demon born from the same
                            layer, something stirs. It is not affection, but recognition. The bond is powerful
                            and often immediate. It is not always healthy. It is not always safe. But it is
                            real.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Helborn cultures form around this tension. They build lives that soothe the pull of
                            their origin. Some focus on stability and tradition. Others chase sensation or
                            silence. Many wander, not because they are lost, but because they fear what will
                            happen if they stop moving. They are not evil. They are not doomed. They are people
                            who could have been monsters, but are not. And that makes every choice they make
                            matter more.

                                <p>The Desolate are shaped by silence. Born from the layer of the Ordealis known
                                    as the Fields of Desolation, their souls were forged in endless stillness
                                    beneath pale, unmoving skies. In that realm, there are no voices, no
                                    comfort, no reprieve. Only time, wind, and the long erosion of self. Those
                                    who carry its mark often grow into quiet observers, hardened by the absence
                                    of connection. They are drawn to company but struggle to feel part of it.
                                    This contradiction defines their lives.

                                    grow like broken earth from their brow. Desolate Helborn form large families
                                    or communal groups to push back against the isolation burned into their
                                    souls. Within these circles, they are deeply loyal and fiercely protective.
                                    They are not cold. They are simply waiting to feel warm again.

                                    The Rustfiend are born of the Iron Dominion, a brutal layer of the Ordealis
                                    where pain is function and identity is replaced with utility. In this realm,
                                    souls are tested through work, repetition, and the stripping of will. The
                                    Rustfiend emerged from this place fused with its lessons. Their flesh is
                                    touched by cursed metal, and their horns curve like wrought iron left too

                                    work of the hands. They are not emotionless, but their feelings have learned
                                    to move beneath the surface, waiting for something worth igniting them. A

                                <p>
                                    The Soulshade Helborn are born from the Clockwork Abyss, a layer of the
                                    Ordealis where time fractures and spirits drift between ticking gears and
                                    frozen echoes. In that place, the soul is tested not by pain or power, but
                                    by memory. Voices of the dead linger like dust in a machine, whispering
                                    regrets and forgotten truths. The Soulshade emerged from these echoes
                                    touched by the unseen, their bodies thinned by spirit interaction, their
                                    eyes dimmed by all they’ve seen.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They are quiet, perceptive, and strangely calming. Others speak of how time
                                    slows around them. They rarely lie but rarely speak the whole truth either.
                                    Soulshades are natural mediums, drawing spirits not through ritual, but by
                                    proximity. Many work as guides, interpreters, or grief-bearers. Some become
                                    obsessed with the dead, while others see themselves as their protectors.
                                    Their skin is faint and cool, and their horns curl like smoke caught in
                                    windless rooms.

                                <p>The Inkshadow are the offspring of the Library of Demons, a realm where
                                    knowledge is hoarded like gold and memory becomes obsession. The trials of
                                    Inkshadow are not physical. They are cerebral, built to seduce with
                                    curiosity until the soul forgets itself in pursuit of answers. Helborn from
                                    this layer are born with memories that do not belong to them. They dream in
                                    languages they have never heard and often carry the weight of questions with
                                    no answers.

                                    Their skin is marked with living ink, shifting slightly with mood or memory.
                                    Their horns are smooth and curved, lined with etched script that pulses
                                    softly when near magic. Inkshadows are drawn to language, secrets, and
                                    forbidden texts. Many isolate themselves, fearing their addiction to
                                    information. Others live without books entirely, reciting their knowledge
                                    aloud to forget it more quickly. They are teachers, wanderers, and sometimes
                                    dangerous archivists.

                                <p>Echo Horn Helborn are born from the Discordant Symphony, a realm in the
                                    Ordealis where sound itself is sacred and volatile. In that layer, harmony
                                    is law and dissonance is punishment. Souls are tested not through silence,
                                    but through overwhelming noise, choruses of memory, shrieking regret, and
                                    the sharp, perfect pitch of divine truth. Those who survive do not forget
                                    the music. It echoes in their bones.
                                </p>

                                    Echo Horns carry that resonance with them. Their horns spiral like clefs or
                                    tuning forks, and their skin bears flowing patterns like staves or vibrating
                                    waveforms. They speak rhythmically without meaning to. Their voices can calm
                                    a crowd or shatter glass, depending on the cadence. Some choose to live as
                                    wandering musicians or diplomats. Others isolate themselves to avoid their
                                    own destructive potential.

                                <p>Icereavers are shaped in the Silent Void, a frozen layer of the Ordealis
                                    where even the soul’s voice can be entombed in ice. In this realm, trials
                                    take the form of stillness and solitude. Time does not pass in warmth but in
                                    breath that crystallizes and falls. Emotion becomes a liability. Speech
                                    invites shattering. The Helborn who emerge from this place do so cloaked in
                                    frost and silence.

                                    like frozen spears, and their eyes reflect the cold eternity they carry
                                    inside. They speak rarely, and when they do, their words cut with clarity.
                                    Icereavers are often drawn to sentinel roles, guardianship, or quiet
                                    vengeance. Their culture values restraint and endurance, and many live far
                                    from cities, surrounded by snow or quiet stone.

                                    breath on cold glass. This realm carries whispers that once belonged to
                                    names now lost, and the souls that pass through it often forget who they
                                    were before they reach the other side. Those who carry its mark into the
                                    waking world are elusive by nature, difficult to pin down and harder to

                                    Helborn speaks softly and often says little, but their presence lingers long
                                    after they are gone. Some become couriers or spies, others serve as
                                    caretakers of the dying, guiding final moments into peace. They are calm,
                                    unreadable, and difficult to truly know.

                                    for survival. From this place come the Helborn who embody pain refined into
                                    skill, rage tempered by discipline, and fury harnessed into clarity.

                                    plainly and hold few illusions. Their trust must be earned through battle or
                                    sacrifice. Many serve as bodyguards, champions, or ruthless tacticians. Some
                                    try to escape the violence in their blood, but most accept it and find

                                <p>The Moraltus are Helborn touched not by the wild layers of the Ordealis, but
                                    by its highest order. They descend from the Temple of Asmodeus, a bastion of
                                    law and control seated deep in the infernal planes. Within this temple,
                                    contracts are sacred and morality is measured in structure rather than
                                    emotion. Moraltus Helborn are shaped by a force that values order above all
                                    else, and their presence reflects this unnatural balance.

                                    Their skin glows faintly, like polished marble warmed from within, and their
                                    horns spiral upward with an almost architectural grace. They walk with quiet
                                    confidence and often serve as leaders, judges, or mediators. While others
                                    fear the demonic within, the Moraltus embrace the discipline it provides,
                                    using it as a framework to build lives of precision and resolve. Their
                                    culture emphasizes honor, loyalty, and a rigid sense of duty.

                                <p>Vozian Helborn were not born in the Ordealis. They were born in the
                                    blood-soaked aftermath of VoZo’s descent. When the blood of that primordial
                                    god spilled across the prime material, it did not merely corrupt. It
                                    reshaped. Where it touched mortals, some fell. Others rose twisted and new.
                                    These became the Vozian Helborn, creatures not of twisted souls, but of
                                    poisoned creation.

                                    lifeless glint of something that remembers too much. Their horns are
                                    fractured, reptilian, and scatter across their bodies like bone plating.
                                    They do not speak of pain, but it follows them. While elves embraced the
                                    magic of VoZo with purpose, humans soaked in it became something unstable
                                    and dangerous. Vilians, martyrs, and monsters alike may trace their roots to
                                    this event.

                                    The Abyssal Helborn is a creature of darkness and otherworldly power. Its
                                    skin glows with the ethereal hues of twilight, and its body is adorned with
                                    sharp and asymmetrical horns.
                                    They are feared and shunned by society due to their otherworldly origins,
                                    but they possess a culture that is rich and mysterious. They are known to be
                                    powerful and formidable, but also
                                    quite reclusive, choosing to keep to themselves and their own kind.

                                    to ensnare the souls of those they grapple with, drawing them into the
                                    abyss. Often viewed as loners, they can
                                    also be part of a tight-knit community. They are very protective of their
                                    own kind and will fiercely defend them if threatened. Some are quite wise
                                    and knowledgeable, possessing ancient
                                    secrets not shared with outsiders. They have a strong sense of pride and

                        <h3>Seraphim</h3>
                        <p>They descend when the sky cracks. Always alone. Always too late to save everyone. The
                            Seraphim do not travel in groups, do not settle in towns, and do not explain themselves.
                            They appear with blood on their robes and leave before it dries. Seraphim are not born of
                            love or lineage. Most were once mortal, reshaped by divine fire after lifetimes of service,
                            sacrifice, or suffering. Others are older than memory, remnants of the gods’ first commands,
                            still obeying edicts no one recalls. Whether new or ancient, they are made the same way:
                            through the death of the self.

                        </p>
                        <p>They do not age. They vanish. Some say they return to the Celestial Plane to serve in silence
                            until called again. Others believe they flicker between worlds, adrift, forgotten even by
                            the gods who made them. Seraphim do not share mortal values. They do not weep for the dead
                            or celebrate survival. Their morality is structured, rigid, beautiful and cruel. A child
                            spared may mean a city left to burn. A village saved may be razed two years later because
                            the Seraphim read something in the threads of fate that no one else could see.
                        </p>
                        <p>Their presence is not comforting. It is humbling. Wherever they arrive, people kneel without
                            knowing why. Children go quiet and dogs flee. Their culture is oral but sacred. They pass
                            stories through gesture, light, and shared memory, not sound. When Seraphim meet, they do
                            not speak. They remember together. And when they part, they forget.

                                    the god who does not speak of freedom but of order. He is the god of Power, Control,
                                    Domination, Ability, and Leadership. His angels descend in silence, their limbs
                                    wrapped in celestial chains, their eyes fixed on those who would disrupt the natural
                                    weight of consequence.

                                    Brakkus is not cruel, but he is exacting. He does not punish emotion or rebellion,
                                    only the failure to bear the burden of choice. The Shackleborn exist to remind the
                                    world that justice does not kneel. Their presence is a sentence. Their wings do not
                                    lift them skyward, instead they drag behind like relics from an older war,
                                    whispering the names of those already judged. Each Shackleborn carries a portion of
                                    divine restraint, etched into their form. To see one is to know that something has
                                    gone too far. To hear their chains is to know it has been noticed.

                                    expressions, hands move a fraction too fast, and their wings pulse like frozen
                                    lightning. They are the archivists of reality’s shape, correcting timelines not with
                                    blades, but with presence. A look, a word, a step too soon. They undo what should
                                    not have happened.

                                    Chronal Wardens do not interfere with fate. They preserve the edge between fate and
                                    chaos. When they appear, it is rarely to fight, but always to intervene. Where they
                                    pass, time bends, and those near them feel the weight of every mistake they never
                                    made.

                                <p>Resonance angels are the echoes of Dumda’s will, formed from layered vibration and
                                    boundless tone. They do not walk. They hum. Their presence bends the air, their

                                    message. Where they move, silence gives way to harmony, and disharmony is shattered.
                                    Dumda is the god of Sound, Frequency, Connection, Bonds, and Music. Sound is their
                                    language, but also their weapon. The voice of a Resonance carries the weight of
                                    order, not through volume but through clarity. One perfect note can bring down
                                    deception, draw truth to the surface, or reduce confusion to stillness.

                        <p>
                            Despite their playful and often mischievous demeanor, these Etherians can exhibit
                            unpredictable temperaments, especially if provoked. Their fluid nature
                            makes them adept at blending into the world's myriad landscapes, yet a profound
                            disconnect remains. Deep down, they grapple with understanding the unwavering
                            certainties of the waking world, a stark contrast to the ever-shifting sands of the
                            Dreamsea from which they emerged.

                                    The Dreamborn are a species of humanoid creatures born from the realm of
                                    dreams, the Dreamsea. They possess an ethereal and otherworldly presence,
                                    and are known for their fun-loving and joyful nature. Their mere presence
                                    has a way of bringing out the best in others, spreading positivity and joy
                                    wherever they go.
                                    They possess a unique ability to tap into the subconscious minds of those

                                    The Nightmare Brood are a terrifying and malevolent species born from the
                                    realm of nightmares. They feed off of fear and negative emotions, and
                                    have the ability to manifest in the physical world to torment their victims.
                                    They possess a distorted and monstrous appearance, resembling twisted
                                    versions of humanity,
                                    often causing those who encounter them to see them as their own loved ones
                                    or as someone who has passed away. They are known to prey on the vulnerable

                                    using their powers to manipulate and control their victims. They are also

                    <h3>Goblijjins</h3>
                    <p>
                        Deep within the annals of history, the Goblijjins emerged from the very essence of VoZo,
                        the Primordial Evil that once threatened to consume Shek.
                        Born of chaos and malevolence, their early ancestors were feared, loathed, and branded
                        as the living symbols of evil's persistence in the world.
                        Yet, time has a way of reshaping destinies, and the Goblijjins of today are a testament
                        to that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the sprawling grasslands to the hidden alleyways of cities, Goblijjins have found
                        their place. While the shadow of their sinister lineage does loom
                        over them, the Goblijjins have strived hard to redefine themselves. But society, often
                        harsh and unforgiving, has rarely been welcoming. To most, Goblijjins are
                        still the remnants of an era best forgotten, and they face the brunt of that prejudice.
                        With the deck stacked against them, many Goblijjins embrace roles that benefit
                        the greater good, hoping to find a measure of acceptance. Yet, the world remains wary,
                        keeping them at arm's length.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In their heart of hearts, every Goblijjin struggles with their innate mischievous
                        nature. Whether it's a sly prank, a cheeky comment, or simply being a "little stinker,"
                        it's hardwired into their very being. It's not just a choice; it's a part of who they
                        are, a reminder of their tumultuous origin. This playful, sometimes disruptive,
                        behavior often gets them into trouble, further alienating them from other species. Their
                        names, often odd and humorous like "Snotbubble" or "Wiggletoe," are a reflection
                        of their unique culture and perspective on life. For a species with such a fleeting
                        lifespan, every moment is a celebration, every day a dance. There's a saying among
                        Goblijjins:
                        "Live for the giggle, for tomorrow we might not be here to hear it." And live they do,
                        with a fervor and zest that few can match.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the most distinct characteristics of the Goblijjins is their black, flaky blood.
                        When exposed to the air, it crystallizes and turns to ash, drifting away with the wind.
                        A poignant metaphor for their transient lives, perhaps. Despite the challenges they
                        face, the Goblijjins are a testament to resilience, adaptability, and the indomitable
                        spirit
                        to rise above one's origins. While the world may not always be kind to them, the
                        Goblijjins of Shek continue to carve out their place, one mischievous giggle at a time.

                                    throughout the world is a testament to their adaptability and resilience.
                                    From the sprawling grasslands to the deepest, forgotten dungeons, one can find
                                    traces of these tenacious beings. Their language, a unique dialect known as
                                    "Gutter Common," stands as a symbol of their distinct identity, even if it's often
                                    misunderstood by others.

                                            These little rascals, often named with playful and bizarre monikers
                                            like "Gigglemud" or "Plopfoot", live in transient communities that rise and
                                            fall with the seasons. Their lives are a blend of mischief and survival,
                                            as they harness their innate cunning to navigate the challenges of the wild.
                                            Wild Goblins are known for their unyielding spirit and an uncanny ability
                                            to adapt quickly to their surroundings, making them elusive adversaries and
                                            curious allies.

                                            The bustling streets of Shek's cities are home to a different breed of
                                            goblins - the City Goblins. They have traded the vast open wilderness for
                                            the intricate
                                            labyrinths of urban life. Dressed in whatever finery they can acquire, often
                                            with an eccentric flair, these goblins are savvy traders, skilled artisans,
                                            and street-smart entrepreneurs.
                                            Their names often reflect their trades or peculiar habits, leading to
                                            goblins called "Silkthread" or "Dingledangle". Even in the cities, their
                                            mischievous nature shines,
                                            but it's tempered with a keen sense of business acumen.

                                            A darker, more enigmatic offshoot of the goblin lineage, the Vozian Goblins
                                            trace their roots directly to the heart of VoZo's malevolent power. Often
                                            found in the
                                            haunting landscapes of the Ashlands, they stand taller and exude an aura of
                                            mysterious energy. Their matte violet skin sets them apart, and their names,

                                            "Shadowgleam" or "Gloomwhisper", hint at their deeper connection to the
                                            ancient evil. These goblins are a wild force, driven by an insatiable
                                            curiosity and a desire to reclaim
                                            the legacy of their forebears.

                                <h3>Hojjoblin</h3>
                                <p>Hojjoblins are the shattered proof that power leaves a mark long after it fades. Once
                                    goblins, they were twisted into new forms when Faulkaust the Ruby Lich drove
                                    crystalline magic into their flesh. Faulkaust was no hermit necromancer hidden away
                                    in some crypt. He was a tyrant who challenged gods and empires alike, reshaping the
                                    battlefield and the world with each crimson blast. At the peak of his reign, the
                                    Hojjoblins served as shock troops and siege tacticians, and some even kings, forged
                                    to match his hunger for domination.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then, Falkaust vanished. No one knows how. Some say the gods finally struck him
                                    down. Others believe he pierced the Veil and escaped into time itself. Whatever
                                    truth lies behind his disappearance, the Hojjoblins were left behind to pick up the
                                    pieces. Without their master, they changed again. Some sought discipline and
                                    structure, refining their minds and building complex societies that value planning,
                                    mastery, and leadership. Others rejected order and turned to the wilds, where
                                    instinct and ambition shaped them into nomadic tacticians and primal inventors.
                                    These two paths have since diverged into distinct breeds, though both still bear the
                                    crimson shimmer in their skin and the drive to outpace their past.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They live short lives, rarely more than forty years, and they live them fast. Few
                                    Hojjoblins sleep deeply. Fewer still look back. Their souls are marked twice; first
                                    by the corruption of VoZo, then by Faulkaust’s touch. They carry that dual weight
                                    like armor. Many seek greatness not for glory, but to prove they are more than what
                                    created them. To be a Hojjoblin is to be born with a curse and handed the tools to
                                    break it.

                                </p>

                                        <p>The red-skinned Hojjoblins of the frontier are not beasts. They are
                                            tacticians without blueprints, warlords without cities, and engineers of
                                            violence shaped by nature’s fury. Known only as the Wild Hojjoblins by
                                            outsiders, they call themselves nothing. They don’t need names to know who
                                            leads or who kills best. Born from goblins impaled by Faulkaust’s ruby
                                            spires, these Hojjoblins did not stay near the ruins of their creation. They
                                            fled into the unclaimed lands, bleeding intellect and instinct. The crimson
                                            stain never left them. It darkened their skin, sharpened their bones, and
                                            burned precision into their instincts. Where others survive, they dominate.
                                            Where others build, they overtake.

                                        <p>
                                            Their black hair grows thick and tangled, often braided with bone or wire.
                                            Their eyes are reflective pools of blood and calculation. Wild Hojjoblins do
                                            not speak in ranks or politics. They speak in angles, trajectories, and
                                            probability. Every raid is planned for, to the second. Every retreat is
                                            bait. Every death serves the next kill. They feel no need to return to
                                            civilization. Why go back to the towers, when the forest is already theirs?
                                            Why serve a king, when you can build a warpath that never ends? To face a
                                            Wild Hojjoblin is not to fight a person. It is to challenge a living
                                            stratagem that has already accounted for your next five moves.

                                        <p>When the towers fell and the red light faded, not all Hojjoblins ran into the
                                            wilds. Some stayed behind in the broken cities Faulkaust once ruled, digging
                                            into the ruins and rewriting the blueprints. These became the Falken.
                                            Refined, relentless, and quietly ambitious, they remember who made them and
                                            see no reason to forget. Falken are tall for goblinkind, with smooth violet
                                            or lavender skin that gives them an almost regal quality. Unlike their wild
                                            kin, whose black hair grows coarse and wild, Falken often have fine, silken
                                            strands they style, sometimes straight, sometimes curled tight, and
                                            sometimes barely growing at all. Their eyes shimmer faintly with internal
                                            calculation, always scanning, always measuring.
                                        </p>

                                            In cities, they are architects of influence. Some design bridges or rail
                                            systems, others design networks of information or power. Their minds move in
                                            patterns others struggle to see, always seeking efficiency, elevation, and
                                            legacy. Falken are often known by a single name or title, their identity
                                            tied not to clan but to accomplishments. They rarely show emotion, but their
                                            passion lies just under the surface. To them, every flaw is a challenge,
                                            every system a puzzle. They do not dream of perfection. They engineer it.

                                            The Vozian Hojgoblins are the shadowy enforcers of the night, born of an
                                            ancient lineage that despises arcane forces. Their very presence is a bane
                                            to spellcasters,
                                            as they have honed their abilities to counter and disrupt magic. With skin

                                            magic with malevolent intent. Their hatred for magic is as much a part of

                    <h3>Jotun</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jotun, once formidable beings of incomprehensible might and stature, have become
                        entities shrouded in enigma and dark tales.
                        Thousands of years prior, their kind, the True Giants, were expelled or driven from the
                        prime material plane through a tumult of cosmic-scale events and ethereal politics
                        that were far beyond their control or comprehension. Yet, the ripple of their ancient
                        presence still lingers hauntingly across the lands, and their descendants, although
                        diminished,
                        tread cautiously in a world that has grown wary of their lineage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The True Giants, beings of incredible power and stature, were banished to the distant
                        realms by the celestial powers, forever locked away from the prime material plane due to
                        a cascade
                        of cataclysmic occurrences and divine interventions. Their banishment, wrought with
                        sorrow and wrath, echoed through the cosmos, leaving a scar in the collective memory of
                        all beings in Shek.
                        Even now, these giants, known as the "Banished", linger in their distant, secluded
                        realms, their hearts heavy with the burden of lost epochs and a deep yearning for the
                        world they were torn away from.

                    <p>
                        In the contemporary epoch of Shek, those of Jotun lineage walk a precarious path,
                        ever-shadowed by the colossal specters of their ancestors. Three distinct species of
                        half-giants, each bearing
                        the diluted yet still formidable blood of their forebears, inhabit the world, each
                        uniquely adapted to their struggle for acceptance and survival amidst a populace that
                        regards them with a mixture
                        of awe and trepidation.

                                In the epoch before recorded time, Shek was a tempestuous realm, constantly wracked by
                                the chaotic fury of the elements. This world, brimming with raw elemental potential,
                                was a cacophony of roaring thunder, raging infernos, surging tides, and howling gales.
                                It was during this tumultuous age that the God Dragon Khalas descended upon Shek,
                                drawn by the planet's untamed energy.

                                the luminescence of a thousand stars. With wings vast enough to blanket entire
                                cities and eyes that held the wisdom of the cosmos, Khalas was a deity of unparalleled
                                power. As the mighty dragon landed, the storms themselves seemed to bow before
                                this majestic entity, waiting in bated anticipation. Drawing upon an ancient and arcane
                                rite, Khalas inhaled deeply, absorbing the wild elemental tempests that raged
                                across Shek. Every bolt of lightning, every lick of flame, every gust of wind, and every
                                crashing wave was drawn into the God Dragon's maw. The very fabric of the world

                                birthed the Crumbling Void. This vast expanse, a space where the elements met
                                and melded, became a canvas upon which new life would be painted. With each subsequent
                                breath, Khalas infused the void with fragments of the elements, giving birth
                                to the myriad species of dragons that would come to populate Shek.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From the fiery breath of Khalas came the Crimson Pyre Dragons, embodiments of flame and
                                fury. The cool exhalations birthed the Glacial Shard Dragons, masters of frost
                                and ice. The gentle sighs brought forth the Cloudburst Dragons, rulers of the skies and
                                storms. And so, with each breath, a new lineage of dragons was formed, each inheriting
                                a fragment of Khalas's elemental might.

                                In the ages that followed, these dragons would go on to shape the history and destiny of
                                Shek. They carved out territories, established dynasties, and played pivotal roles
                                in the world's evolving narrative. Yet, they never forgot their divine origins, always
                                paying homage to Khalas, the God Dragon who breathed life into their kind.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though Khalas's physical presence has long since faded from Shek, the legacy of that
                                fateful day remains. The dragons, in all their elemental splendor, are a testament
                                to the God Dragon's creative force. They are not just creatures of myth and legend, but
                                living embodiments of Shek's primal history, forever soaring through its skies,
                                guarding its secrets, and shaping its future.

                                <p>Barb Dragons are bigger than average dragons and have bulkier bodies. They
                                    are covered in muted-hued, thorny scales that not only serve as armor but
                                    also as a weapon. These dragons have limited intellect and are driven
                                    primarily by instinct and hunger. They are territorial and aggressive
                                    towards intruders, who often find themselves faced with a cloud of sharp
                                    spikes when encroaching on a Barb Dragon's domain. These dragons have a
                                    mouth full of barbs, the large dragon's breath weapon is a spray of these
                                    barbs.

                                    As a Drakonari, you embody a mystifying fusion of man and dragon. Your
                                    existence is a riddle, a phenomenon that baffles many, born from the
                                    improbable union of the mundane and the mythical.
                                    You bear features of both lineages—scales glinting like armor, eyes glowing
                                    with ancient wisdom, and a humanoid form that stands tall and proud. Your
                                    voice carries an echo of draconic roars,
                                    and your breath hints at the elemental power inherited from your draconic
                                    parentage.

                                    With this awe-inspiring blend comes fear and unease. People are wary of your
                                    dragon lineage, and dragons are skeptical of your human side. But the
                                    potential within you is undeniable.
                                    How you wield this power, whether for good or ill, is your choice. Prove to
                                    the world that being a "bad dragon" means being extraordinarily formidable,
                                    not feared.

                                    any Kobbie clever enough to find and free Karl will be granted immortality, along
                                    with a crown made from the first ever Kobbie gear.

                    <h3>Symbiotes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Symbiotes are an enigmatic and ancient species known for their unique ability to form
                        powerful bonds with various hosts.
                        They can be found in the darkest corners and most sacred spaces of the world, attracted
                        to beings with strong capabilities
                        and unique traits. They enhance their host's abilities while deriving sustenance and
                        other benefits from the bond. These
                        extraordinary creatures exist in various forms, such as the aggressive Parasitic
                        Symbiotes and the wise Eternal Worms.
                        Each symbiote offers a distinct set of skills and enhancements, making them highly
                        sought-after companions for those who
                        can handle the challenges and responsibilities of hosting such powerful beings. Their
                        bonds with their hosts create a
                        profound and life-changing connection, forever altering the destinies of both parties
                        involved.

                        <h4>Symbiote Removal</h4>
                        <p>
                            Removing a symbiote is a dangerous and delicate process. A successful Medicine check
                            is
                            required to safely remove the symbiote
                            without causing harm to the host or the symbiote. If the check fails, the host and
                            symbiote each take damage and may suffer
                            from various conditions or penalties.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Being Without a Host</h4>
                        <p>
                            Symbiotes can survive outside of a host for a number of hours equal to their
                            Survival
                            check. If they do not find a willing or
                            otherwise suitable host within that time, they immediately take the Death condition.

                            Parasitic Symbiotes are a mysterious and ancient species that have evolved to form
                            powerful and aggressive symbiotic
                            relationships with various hosts. Found deep within the darkest corners of the

                                    after hitting an object when thrown and doesn't hold its shape unless held
                                    by you. You also have the ability to shift
                                    the size of your body slightly larger or smaller.</li>
                                <li><strong>Host Control:</strong> Choose how you would like to bond with your
                                    host:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Symbiosis:</strong> A host bonded through Symbiosis lasts up
                                            to one year or until the host dies.
                                            To bond, the symbiote must succeed on an Influence Check to convince
                                            the host of the mutual benefits of
                                            their relationship. Once bonded, the symbiote grants the host the
                                            ability to double a check once per long rest.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Devourer:</strong> A host bonded through Devourer lasts for
                                            one month or until the host dies.
                                            To bond, the symbiote must win a contested Strength Check to
                                            forcibly overtake the host's body. On a failure,
                                            the host is immune to the Devourer while alive. Once bonded, the
                                            symbiote enhances the host’s combat
                                            capabilities, granting +1 to melee attack checks and damage.
                                            Additionally, the host gains the ability to heal
                                            themselves as an action for [[6 Healing]] or remove one Corpus
                                            Condition as an action, usable once per long rest.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Passenger:</strong> A host bonded through Passenger lasts
                                            indefinitely, as the symbiote thrives
                                            in secrecy without overtly harming the host. To bond, the symbiote
                                            must succeed on a Stealth Check to
                                            infiltrate the host’s body without their knowledge. Once bonded, the
                                            Passenger can, as an action, grant the
                                            host Invisibility until the end of their next turn or until they
                                            take an aggressive action. This bond allows
                                            the Passenger to act as a silent companion, leveraging the host’s
                                            body for its own goals while avoiding detection.</li>

                            Firstborn resemble dark-skinned elves with a few distinct features. They have

                            They say the Strigoi were around before even Lord Vozo, but many others believe Vozo
                            was
                            the one that gave them undead
                            their true power. These are a breed of human that fear nothing of death, for they
                            have
                            already tasted it. They run rampant
                            in the Kingslands but now even Ostrio is tasting the fruit of the dead trees that
                            the

                                <p>
                                    In the spectral hierarchy of strigoi, the Tristeţe are the outcasts, the forsaken.
                                    Their name, translating to 'sadness',
                                    poignantly mirrors their existence. These unfortunate vampires, transformed into
                                    lesser beings by disease, foul magic, or
                                    tragic incidents, bear grotesque deformities. Their skin, weak and light-sensitive,
                                    compels them to lurk in the shadows, away
                                    from the sun's harsh judgment and society's scorn. Immortal, their existence is an
                                    endless nocturnal cycle.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Shunned and often slain on sight, the Tristeţe survive by adopting disguises, their
                                    true forms concealed beneath layers of
                                    illusion. Despite their tragic circumstances, they outnumber their nobler
                                    counterparts, their prevalence a harsh testament
                                    to the vampire world's realities. Their deformed bodies, grotesquely resilient, can
                                    regenerate wounds unless exposed to
                                    sunlight or holy water. However, their light sensitivity is a severe weakness, with
                                    the sun's rays inflicting wounds that
                                    their bodies labor to heal. Holy symbols and radiant damage are particularly
                                    harmful, their unholy nature rendering them
                                    vulnerable to such forces.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Tristeţe embody the vampire legend's darker side, a stark contrast to the
                                    nobility and allure often associated with
                                    their kind. They are the forsaken, the deformed, the sorrowful, their existence a
                                    haunting reminder of the tragic
                                    possibilities lurking in the vampire world's shadows.

                                    centuries of relentless training and battle. Their
                                    skin, ashen and cold, is a stark contrast to the vibrant crimson of the blood that
                                    sustains them. Their eyes, a piercing silver,
                                    radiate an intimidating presence, a clear warning to any who dare to cross their
                                    path.

                                    Their wings, massive and powerful, are not just for show. They are fully functional,
                                    capable of carrying the Tărie into the sky.
                                    But these wings serve another purpose. They are strong and dexterous enough to wield
                                    additional simple melee weapons, turning the
                                    Tărie into a whirlwind of steel and fury on the battlefield. This unique ability
                                    allows them to engage multiple enemies at once.

                                    The Înviere are a haunting testament to the power of the undying, a species born
                                    from failed resurrections and ancient, mystical
                                    connections. Their existence is a paradox, caught between life and death, yet
                                    belonging to neither. They are the children of the
                                    Undying King and the Lord of Winter, Kharn, embodying the chilling touch of death
                                    and the relentless endurance of the cold.

                                    Their bodies bear the marks of their death and resurrection, making each Înviere a
                                    unique tapestry of life's end and its defiance.
                                    Their eyes glow with an eerie light, a beacon in the darkness they navigate so well.
                                    They move with purpose and intent, their
                                    actions driven by inscrutable goals known only to them and their undying deities.

                                    The Înviere are a striking sight to behold, their forms a chilling echo of the life
                                    they once lived. They bear the visage of their
                                    former humanoid selves, yet their skin is pallid and cold, ranging in tones from the
                                    lightest alabaster to the deepest ebony. Their
                                    bodies are often marked by the circumstances of their death, with scars, wounds, and
                                    other signs of their mortal end etched permanently
                                    into their flesh.

                                        The Nemuri Gargoyles are a unique and mysterious species, born from the stone of
                                        the Nemuri sea. Their bodies glow with a
                                        strange luminescence, a reflection of their connection to dreams and memories.
                                        They are capable of flight, a skill they use
                                        to traverse the Nemuri plane and explore the mysteries of the universe. They are
                                        also capable of releasing a burst of radiant
                                        energy, a manifestation of their Nemuri power that can harm those who threaten
                                        their peace. They are a rare and enigmatic
                                        species, seen as the keepers of dreams and the guardians of the Nemuri plane.

                            Zoanthropes, also known as shifters or half-men, are a unique species of creatures
                            that possess both human
                            and animal traits. They are neither wholly human nor wholly animal, placing them
                            outside of society's norms
                            and conventions. They have the ability to shift between human and animal forms, a
                            skill that sets them apart
                            and makes them both fascinating and feared. Known for their strong connections to
                            the natural world, they
                            possess heightened senses, strength, and agility. While revered by some cultures as
                            protectors of the natural
                            world, they are often ostracized and discriminated against, seen as freaks and
                            outsiders. They frequently form
                            tight-knit communities where they can find acceptance among their own kind.

                                        These shifters possess a strong predatory heritage and are characterized by
                                        their sharp claws and powerful jaws.
                                        They are skilled hunters, often preying on meat to sustain themselves. Rarely
                                        found in cities, they prefer a tribal
                                        lifestyle where they can hunt and roam freely. Fierce and powerful, they are
                                        often seen as protectors of their tribe.

                                        and quick, they can fly and soar with the grace of a bird. Often found near

                                        These shifters possess a strong aquatic heritage, characterized by their ability
                                        to shift into a full aquatic form
                                        such as fish or marine mammals. Equipped with powerful fins, gills, and webbed
                                        extremities, they excel in
                                        underwater environments. With heightened senses underwater and the ability to
                                        communicate with aquatic
                                        creatures, they are considered protectors of the ocean and its inhabitants.
                                        Often found near coastal or aquatic
                                        communities, they are known for their peaceful and loyal nature.

                                        The Satyrs are a mystical and mischievous breed of shifters, deeply tied to the
                                        feywild and the untamed forces
                                        of nature. Often mistaken for beastmen, Satyrs possess a unique blend of
                                        humanoid intelligence and feral
                                        instinct. With goat-like features such as cloven hooves, small horns, and nimble
                                        frames, their true essence lies
                                        in their connection to the fey.

                                    <p>
                                        Natural performers and instigators, Satyrs thrive in chaos and revelry, wielding
                                        haunting melodies and
                                        captivating charm to influence others. Despite their playful demeanor, they are
                                        fiercely protective of their kin
                                        and the wilds they call home. Often found in ancient groves or hidden fey
                                        crossings, they act as guardians and
                                        emissaries of their enigmatic fey ancestry.

                                        In a bitter conflict with the Hellborn Minotaurs over the Thundering Plains,
                                        Centaurs view this battle as a fight
                                        for the survival of their way of life. Agile and fast, they are unmatched in
                                        endurance and maneuverability,
                                        revered as guardians of the plains. Skilled artisans and storytellers, Centaurs
                                        preserve their rich history

                            harsh conditions. Among these

                                    by the dragon goddess Tiamat to wage war against her rivals, these
                                    half-human, half-scorpion beings have
                                    since gained independence. Now residing in the Red Desert, they live
                                    under the rule of the powerful
                                    insect-like Scarab Lords. With their human upper body and scorpion lower
                                    half, Scorpikin possess immense
                                    strength, agility, and an additional pair of pincers that can hold
                                    objects or be used as weapons. Known
                                    for their fierce loyalty and combat prowess, Scorpikin are a force to be
                                    reckoned with on the battlefield.

                                Spiderkin are a unique species of humanoids characterized by their lean,

                                mandibles. Their mandibles make speaking the common tongue difficult, yet
                                they have adapted to communicate
                                effectively. Females of the species are known for their powerful builds and
                                combat abilities, while males
                                are agile and often skilled in magic. Fiercely loyal to their tribes, they
                                are commonly found in wooded or
                                mountainous regions where they spin webs for hunting and protection. Many

                            <h3>Tikkin</h3>
                            <p>
                                Tikkin are a small, elusive species known for their need to survive on
                                blood. With small statures and sharp fangs,
                                they feed on the blood of other creatures. Despite their unique dietary
                                requirements, Tikkin are not inherently
                                violent, often finding non-harmful methods to sustain themselves. However,
                                their nature leads to societal rejection,
                                forcing them to live in the shadows. Fiercely protective of their
                                communities, Tikkin have developed a strong sense
                                of loyalty and care for their own kind. Some have learned to control their
                                blood thirst, while others struggle to
                                overcome their instincts.

                            Avians are a diverse species of beastmen whose feathered forms and flight abilities
                            connect them to the skies.
                            Adapted to various climates and cultures across the world, they range from proud
                            hawk-like warriors to peaceful
                            dove-like diplomats, each embodying unique avian traits. Their cities, suspended
                            among the clouds or perched atop
                            towering peaks, are marvels of architecture, blending natural beauty with
                            engineering precision. These skybound
                            civilizations are steeped in ancient feathered traditions, including the sacred
                            "Molting Ceremony," where feathers
                            lost in combat or hardship are ritually honored as symbols of resilience.

                            Avians are natural navigators, known for their ability to traverse great distances
                            with ease, making them revered
                            messengers and scouts. While fiercely protective of their aerial territories, Avians
                            often serve as bridges between
                            grounded civilizations, bringing knowledge, trade, and diplomacy from one land to
                            another. Their language, Naech
                            (or Trill), is a melodic combination of chirps, whistles, and harmonics that echoes
                            their heritage. As guardians of
                            the skies and keepers of the winds, Avians hold their ancient traditions as dearly
                            as they do their freedom, soaring
                            through history as symbols of unity and wisdom.

                                        Corvus are a unique avian subspecies born under the patronage of the gods Huginn
                                        and Muninn. Those born under
                                        Huginn are intelligent crows, while those under Muninn are ravens cursed by a
                                        fey deity with perfect memory,
                                        though they can only speak in mimicry if they choose to. This duality of

                                        The Hawk humanoids, also known as Avian Knights, are a proud and honorable
                                        species. Their bodies are covered in
                                        feathers, with wings that allow short flights or gliding over long distances.
                                        Their sharp talons, combined with their
                                        strength and agility, make them exceptional hunters and warriors. Hawks are
                                        organized in a feudal system, where each
                                        territory has its own lord responsible for the safety and well-being of their
                                        people.

                                        leaders. Known for their bravery, loyalty, and commitment to justice, they
                                        dedicate their lives to training and
                                        discipline to become the best warriors. Fiercely independent but compassionate,
                                        Hawks symbolize hope and are revered
                                        as defenders of the weak. Whether in the air or on the ground, they are a force

                                        virtues of strength, courage, and nobility.

                                        Penguins are a unique subspecies of avian beastmen, adapted to life in cold
                                        coastal regions and the open ocean.
                                        Though flightless, they are exceptional swimmers and agile divers, capable of
                                        navigating icy waters with unmatched
                                        grace. Known for their tightly-knit communities, they build intricate ice
                                        villages along glacial coasts, fortified
                                        against the harsh elements. Penguins hold deep cultural reverence for the
                                        "Eternal Ice," an ancient tradition
                                        celebrating resilience, teamwork, and the bond between the sea and the sky.
                                        These ceremonies involve synchronized
                                        dances and storytelling by elder penguins, recounting legendary migrations and
                                        ocean spirits.

                                        Penguins have strong protective instincts, working cooperatively to guard their

                                        dangers. Their natural resilience and physical adaptations make them excellent

                                        stature and inability to fly, penguins
                                        exemplify determination, resourcefulness, and a profound connection to the
                                        ocean's mysteries.

                                        Phoenixes are rare, mystical avians connected to fire and renewal. Known for
                                        their blazing feathers and the ability to
                                        rise from their ashes, they are symbols of hope and perseverance. Phoenix
                                        societies focus on the cycles of life, death,
                                        and rebirth, with sacred pyres serving as places of renewal and meditation.
                                        Their fiery presence and ability to endure
                                        make them a beacon of resilience and inspiration.

                        <p>
                            Beruklians are a unique and advanced species of ape humanoids that originated from
                            various tropical islands around
                            the world. They have unified on the island of Beruklian, where they have developed a
                            highly organized and hierarchical
                            society. Due to the island's dense population, towering high-rise structures have
                            been constructed to house their
                            vibrant culture. The city is a bustling hub of trade, commerce, and education, with
                            a deep respect for hierarchy and
                            order reflected in every aspect of their society. Even when Beruklians leave the
                            island, they maintain their strong
                            sense of social hierarchy and order, making them a fascinating species to observe.

                                    <p>
                                        The Papio subspecies, also known as baboons, are a group of primates known for
                                        their intimidating and fierce nature.
                                        They are often feared for their aggressive and unpredictable behavior. With
                                        their physical strength, powerful jaws,
                                        and sharp teeth, they are formidable opponents in any situation. While their
                                        wild nature makes them difficult to
                                        domesticate or control, Papios are highly intelligent and adaptable, thriving in
                                        diverse environments. They also
                                        possess a complex social structure and communication system, allowing them to
                                        work effectively in groups despite
                                        their fearsome reputation.

                                        The Lupine (Alpha) subspecies are proud, fiercely loyal leaders, easily
                                        recognized by their striking coats of pure
                                        white or jet black—a mark of their lineage, said to descend from Fenris
                                        themself. Their heritage ties them to
                                        ancient tales of bravery and ferocity, with some Alphas claiming to carry
                                        Fenris’s wild spirit within them. Alphas
                                        are natural-born leaders, often serving as pack heads, tribal chiefs, or war
                                        commanders. While their hot-headed
                                        nature can lead to brash decisions, their determination and unwavering loyalty
                                        inspire those who follow them.

                                        In the wild, Alphas are exceptional hunters, using their keen senses to track
                                        prey and enemies alike. Their booming
                                        howls, resonant and commanding, rally their allies and strike fear into foes.
                                        Despite their impulsive tendencies,
                                        Alphas hold a deep responsibility for their pack’s well-being, often putting

                                        kin. They embody both the strength and flaws of their legendary ancestor.

                                        The nomadic Coyotes are the wandering storytellers and resilient survivalists of
                                        the Caniform species. Often traveling
                                        in small groups or as lone adventurers, they are known for their sharp tongues
                                        and clever antics. Coyotes thrive in open
                                        plains, deserts, and scrublands, where they use their humor and guile to outwit

                                        ancestry. Touched by dark, otherworldly forces, Hellhorns are known for their
                                        quick tempers and relentless ferocity in
                                        battle. Born on windswept plains, they embrace the thrill of the hunt, pursuing
                                        wild game and rival tribes with unmatched
                                        determination. While their infernal heritage often casts them in a sinister
                                        light, many Hellhorns channel their rage
                                        toward protecting their kin or carving out territories to ensure survival.

                                        Hellhorn culture values strength and dominance, with ceremonial duels and
                                        displays of power marking their gatherings.
                                        Some Hellhorns seek redemption, striving to break free from their dark heritage,
                                        while others fully embrace it, using
                                        their infernal resilience to dominate enemies and defend their lands.

                                        protectors of sacred mazes. Their fur often bears intricate, natural patterns
                                        resembling mazes, and their towering
                                        frames exude both mystery and wisdom. Originating as wardens of ancient
                                        dungeons, they are now invaluable guides in
                                        modern cities, where their ability to never lose their way makes them adept

                        <h3>Felidae</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Felidae are a diverse and proud race of feline humanoid creatures found in
                            various regions across the world.
                            Known for their agility, strength, and keen senses, they are skilled hunters and
                            warriors. Felidae have a strong sense
                            of community, often establishing territories where they live and work together in
                            harmony. Their society is deeply
                            rooted in loyalty and kinship, with every member contributing to the wellbeing of
                            the whole.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                        <p>
                            Felidae typically stand between 4-7 ft tall, with slender, muscular bodies and a
                            wide range of fur colors and patterns,
                            including stripes, spots, and solid colors. Their faces resemble those of large
                            cats, with pointed ears, sharp teeth,
                            and distinctive whiskers. They have large, expressive eyes, well-adapted for
                            low-light vision, and their overall
                            appearance exudes both grace and strength.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Culture</h4>
                        <p>
                            Felidae culture is steeped in tradition and a deep connection with the natural
                            world. They have a profound respect for
                            nature's balance and often live in harmony with their surroundings. Skilled hunters
                            and trackers, they rely on their
                            innate abilities to stalk and catch prey. Additionally, Felidae have a strong
                            affinity for music and storytelling,
                            with folklore passed down through generations in the form of songs and tales.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Social Structure</h4>
                        <p>
                            Felidae society is divided into close-knit communities called prides, usually led by
                            a dominant individual or a small
                            group of leaders. These prides consist of families and friends who work together to
                            protect their territory and meet
                            the group's needs. Felidae are fiercely loyal to their pride and will go to great
                            lengths to defend it from external
                            threats.

                                        artisans. Their maritime culture thrives on exploration, trade, and
                                        craftsmanship, with their ships doubling as
                                        floating galleries of intricate carvings and vibrant colors. Once rulers of
                                        ancient kingdoms, the Paka now live in

                                        The Kivuli, or Panthari, are enigmatic and elusive Felidae, often called the
                                        "Shadows of the Jungle." Living in dense
                                        forests or hidden enclaves, they are masters of stealth and ambush tactics.
                                        Their black or darkly patterned fur allows
                                        them to blend seamlessly with their surroundings, making them nearly invisible
                                        in low light. Kivuli culture revolves
                                        around safeguarding ancient knowledge and defending sacred jungle sites. While
                                        they prefer to remain unseen, their
                                        swift and precise strikes leave an unforgettable mark on those who threaten
                                        their home.

                                        Their society values cunning over brute strength, with elders teaching younger

                                        observation, and precision. Kivuli legends speak of "Night Stalkers," legendary
                                        warriors who once protected entire
                                        regions with unmatched stealth and agility.

                                        The Mwendokasi, or Cheetari, are the fastest of all Felidae, known for their
                                        unmatched speed and agility. Found in open
                                        savannahs or expansive grasslands, their slim, muscular builds allow them to
                                        outrun nearly any predator—or prey.
                                        Mwendokasi are revered as messengers, scouts, and first responders in times of
                                        conflict, carrying vital information
                                        across vast distances.

                                        Their culture celebrates swiftness as both a survival tool and a spiritual
                                        connection to the wind. Ritual foot races and
                                        endurance trials are key traditions, showcasing their speed as an offering to
                                        the spirits of the plains. Legends tell

                            peaceful but can become fearsome
                            opponents when needed. Despite their imposing appearance, Half Cloven possess a
                            charm and gentle demeanor that endears

                            rhinoceros-like appearance.

                            wisdom and experience. Decisions
                            are made collectively, giving each member a voice in matters that concern them.
                            Family bonds and friendships are

                                        The Hippokin are contemplative and wise, resembling humanoid hippopotamuses.
                                        Known for their love of rivers and
                                        marshlands, they are natural swimmers and builders, often constructing homes
                                        along waterways. Hippokin are revered
                                        for their intellect and ingenuity, focusing on crafting, invention, and the
                                        exchange of ideas. Their communities serve
                                        as hubs for trade and knowledge, enriching their regions with innovation.

                                        Hippokin take pride in their calm and measured demeanor, often acting as
                                        mediators and problem-solvers. However, when
                                        roused to action, their immense strength and nearly impenetrable hide make them
                                        formidable opponents. Hippokin warriors
                                        are known for using water as a tactical advantage, drawing enemies into terrain
                                        they control.

                                        for their incredible strength and
                                        resilience, they are natural protectors, often serving as guardians of their
                                        communities and territories. With rough,
                                        armor-like skin and massive horns, they are nearly impervious to physical harm,
                                        and their sheer presence can deter most
                                        threats.

                                        Roxodon society values endurance and discipline, emphasizing physical training
                                        and martial skill. Their culture is one
                                        of balance: fierce in defense of their kin but equally compassionate and
                                        generous. Roxodon warriors are celebrated for
                                        charging into battle, using their horns to scatter enemies and break through
                                        defenses.

                            the small mammals they resemble. Gliers thrive on their quick wits, nimble

                            to their surroundings. Though often underestimated due to their size, their

                                        Molefolk are subterranean Gliers with strong, clawed hands designed for digging.
                                        Thriving underground, they excavate
                                        vast tunnel systems for their homes and communities. Resourceful and resilient,
                                        Molefolk are perfectly adapted to life
                                        in dark and confined spaces.

                            Reptilia typically stand between 5-7 ft tall, with bodies covered in tough, scaly
                            skin that comes in a variety of
                            colors and patterns. They have elongated, lizard-like heads with sharp teeth and
                            slit-like eyes. Some Reptilia have
                            tails, while others possess frills, crests, or spines along their bodies. Their
                            limbs are strong and muscular, with

                            Reptilia communities are often found in warm climates such as deserts, jungles, and
                            swamps, where they bask in the sun

                                        constrict enemies. They often adorn themselves with jewelry, tattoos, and
                                        undergo magical or mechanical augmentations
                                        to enhance their abilities. Known for their venomous bites or powerful
                                        constriction abilities, She-Ren are both
                                        dangerous foes and valued allies.

            <!-- Trinity Of PLAGUE -->
            <h4>Trinity of PLague</h4>
            <p class="faint">
                The Trinity of Plague—Gnolls, Scourge, and Vulturkin—are feared and reviled creatures born from
                the god Yeeshnu. Seen as
                harbingers of disease and destruction, their presence is met with hostility in most societies.
                Playing as these creatures
                would be exceptionally challenging in campaigns not centered around plague themes due to their
                stigma, the diseases they
                carry, and their alignment with a god of death and decay.

                    <h3>Trinity of Plague</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Trinity of Plague is a powerful and feared force in the world, born from the god
                        Yeeshnu. This alliance of Gnolls,
                        Scourge, and Vulturkin represents the embodiment of plague and destruction, united in
                        their worship of their deity.
                        While each species is formidable on its own, together they form an unstoppable force of
                        strength, cunning, and mysticism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The gnolls are fierce warriors, known for their immense strength and ferocity in battle.
                        The scourge are numerous and
                        cunning, using their vast numbers to overwhelm enemies. The vulturkin, on the other
                        hand, are powerful mystics, able to
                        wield and control the very essence of the plague itself. This trinity often leads cults
                        of plague-worshippers, granting
                        them boons in exchange for their devotion to Yeeshnu.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Members of the Trinity are outcasts in civilized lands, often killed on sight due to the
                        diseases they carry and the
                        fear they inspire. Playing as a member of the Trinity is a unique challenge, as their
                        presence will be met with caution
                        and distrust, even from allies.

                            Gnolls are a powerful and imposing species, born from the hyena lord Yeeshnu.
                            Known for their brute strength and
                            ferocity in battle, gnolls often lead bands of Scourge and Vulturkin, using
                            their physical dominance to
                            intimidate and control. Fiercely loyal to their clans, gnolls have a strong pack
                            mentality and will fiercely
                            defend their kin and territory.

                        <p>
                            Gnolls are carnivorous, known to hunt and devour their prey whole. Their
                            intimidating presence and unyielding
                            loyalty to their god Yeeshnu make them both fearsome enemies and controversial
                            allies.

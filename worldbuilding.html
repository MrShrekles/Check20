                                <strong>Mundane Lock & Physical Key:</strong>
                                A standard lock that requires a traditional <em>Physical Key</em>. It can range from
                                basic padlocks to more complex tumbler mechanisms. These locks are susceptible to
                                lockpicking or brute force.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Blood Lock & Blood Key:</strong>
                                A <em>Blood Lock</em> requires the touch of blood to open. Depending on the
                                difficulty,
                                it might require the blood of a specific creature, a creature type, or just any
                                generic
                                blood. A <em>Blood Key</em> often takes the form of a dagger-like object that
                                requires a
                                cut to activate, channeling the essence of the wielder into the lock.

                                <strong>Soul Lock & Soul Key:</strong>
                                A <em>Soul Lock</em> remains closed until touched by a specific soul linked to it. In
                                more challenging versions, a soul must be sacrificed for the lock to open. The
                                corresponding <em>Soul Key</em> may manifest as an enchanted crystal or token
                                infused
                                with the required soul or spiritual essence.

                                <strong>Trap Rune Lock & Rune Key:</strong>
                                A <em>Trap Rune Lock</em> detonates when tampered with, layering protective runes
                                that
                                require an <em>Arcane Rune Key</em> to disarm. The key itself is often a magical
                                glyph
                                or talisman that matches the runesâ€™ inscription.

                                <strong>Construct Mimic Lock & Password:</strong>
                                The <em>Construct Mimic Lock</em> is a sentient mechanism resembling a lock but
                                requiring
                                a specific password to deactivate. The lock may interact with those attempting to
                                open
                                it, even bargaining or testing them for entry.

                                <strong>Illusionary Lock & Perception:</strong>
                                An <em>Illusionary Lock</em> appears real but is not truly locked. Often, it hides a
                                secondary trap, tricking the unwary into ignoring other dangers. Observant
                                individuals
                                or those skilled in perception can identify it for what it is.

                                <strong>Tech Lock & Code Key:</strong>
                                A <em>Tech Lock</em> incorporates advanced mechanisms such as keypads, fingerprint
                                readers, or voice-activated commands. These locks require a <em>Code Key</em>, which
                                might be a passphrase, biometric data, or a specific tool like a data chip.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Basic Magic Lock & Spell Key:</strong>
                                This lock relies on simple magical energy and requires a basic incantation or a
                                low-power
                                spell to unlock. The <em>Spell Key</em> might be a single word of power or a
                                specific
                                hand motion.

                                <strong>Celestial Lock & Star Key:</strong>
                                A <em>Celestial Lock</em> glimmers with divine light or cosmic energy. It can only be
                                opened with a <em>Star Key</em>, which might take the form of a constellation map, a
                                blessed object, or a mote of starlight.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Chaos Lock & Entropy Key:</strong>
                                A swirling, unpredictable <em>Chaos Lock</em> shifts and changes form, preventing
                                easy
                                access. The <em>Entropy Key</em> is equally erratic, requiring a random or illogical
                                approach to use properly.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Chronomancy Lock & Temporal Key:</strong>
                                A <em>Chronomancy Lock</em> is bound by time itself, only accessible at specific
                                moments
                                or when manipulated with a <em>Temporal Key</em>, such as a clockwork device or a
                                relic
                                attuned to time magic.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Crystal Lock & Resonance Key:</strong>
                                Crafted from shimmering crystal, the <em>Crystal Lock</em> resonates with specific
                                frequencies. A <em>Resonance Key</em>, often a crystal shard or tuning fork, must
                                match
                                the lock's frequency to open it.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Dragon Lock & Wyrm Key:</strong>
                                Guarded by ancient draconic magic, the <em>Dragon Lock</em> often requires the breath
                                or
                                blood of a dragon to unlock. A <em>Wyrm Key</em> might be a scale, a claw, or a
                                sigil
                                carved in the language of dragons.

                                <strong>Elemental Lock & Element Key:</strong>
                                The <em>Elemental Lock</em> binds its magic to one of the primal forces (fire, water,
                                air, or earth). The <em>Element Key</em> could be a manifestation of the element,
                                such
                                as a flame, a vial of water, or a stone from a sacred place.

                                A <em>Nature Lock</em> thrives with vines, wood, or blooming flowers. It requires a
                                <em>Grove Key</em>, such as a sacred leaf, a druid's token, or a whispered prayer to
                                the
                                forest spirits.

                                A dark and malevolent <em>Vozian Lock</em> pulses with infernal energy. It requires
                                an
                                <em>Infernal Key</em>, often a cursed artifact or a pact with an evil entity, to
                                open.

                        <h3>Trap Power Levels (PL)</h3>
                        <p>Trap PL is a modular system that allows narrators to scale traps for their desired level of
                            danger or challenge. Each PL adds to the damage, range, or complexity of a trap. Use the
                            following guidelines to adapt traps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Traps deal <code>1d6</code> damage per PL (e.g., a PL 2 trap
                                deals
                                <code>2d6</code> damage).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Range:</strong> Trap effects scale by area or target range. A PL 1 trap has a
                                range
                                of 5 ft, increasing by +5 ft per PL. For example, a PL 10 trap would affect a 50 ft
                                radius.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>+Table:</strong> Every 3 PL adds a roll on the +Table for the damage type of the
                                trap. For example, a PL 3 trap would act similarly to a Success+ on a weapon attack,
                                adding
                                effects like conditions or bonus damage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disarm:</strong> Traps can typically be disarmed with either a Physical check
                                (e.g.,
                                Agility or Strength) or a Mental check (e.g., Intellect or Spirit), depending on the
                                trap
                                type.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Generic Trap Types</h4>
                        <p>Below are common trap concepts for narrators to customize. Apply damage types, conditions, or
                            thematic elements as needed.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Dart Trap: </strong>A hidden mechanism fires a projectile when triggered. Damage
                                type can be chosen by the narrator (e.g., Toxic, Piercing, Fire).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Rune Trap:</strong>
                                Magical symbols activate when disturbed, unleashing effects like explosions, curses, or
                                elemental damage. Narrators can define the damage type (e.g., Fire, Lightning, or
                                Psychic).

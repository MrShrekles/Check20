        <h1>Narrator Guide</h1>
        <p>As a narrator, you are the architect of the story and world. This guide includes advice on
            setting up
            challenges, balancing mechanics, and facilitating immersive gameplay.</p>

                <h2>Enemies and NPCs</h2>
                <p>The Power Level (PL) system provides a simple and effective way to create and manage
                    monsters,
                    enemies, and NPCs. This system allows narrators to quickly generate creatures with
                    appropriate
                    stats for any encounter, ensuring balance and flexibility.</p>

                            Specific bonuses may apply for special creatures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standard Damage:</strong> Roll 1d6 + PL for damage, choosing a logical
                            type
                            based on the creature.</li>
                        <li><strong>Capacity: </strong> Capacity is a number of reactions, condition removals, special
                            actions, or plot
                            moments for combat. If this is a traveling NPC or vehicle, these recover after 1 on Press On
                            and all

                        <li><strong>HP:</strong> Instead of Armor and Wounds, npcs and monsters have HP which is a
                            number of points of damage they can take before becoming dead. Monsters do not take the
                            Injured condition, but you could allow an important NPC to have the INjured condiiton</li>
                        <li><strong>Number of Attacks:</strong> A monster could have a numnber of attacks equal to
                            Capacity divided by 3 (minimum of 1), rounded down </li>

                        <strong>Mundane Lock & Physical Key:</strong>
                        A standard lock that requires a traditional <em>Physical Key</em>. It can range from
                        basic padlocks to more complex tumbler mechanisms. These locks are susceptible to
                        lockpicking or brute force.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Blood Lock & Blood Key:</strong>
                        A <em>Blood Lock</em> requires the touch of blood to open. Depending on the
                        difficulty,
                        it might require the blood of a specific creature, a creature type, or just any
                        generic
                        blood. A <em>Blood Key</em> often takes the form of a dagger-like object that
                        requires a
                        cut to activate, channeling the essence of the wielder into the lock.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Soul Lock & Soul Key:</strong>
                        A <em>Soul Lock</em> remains closed until touched by a specific soul linked to it. In
                        more challenging versions, a soul must be sacrificed for the lock to open. The
                        corresponding <em>Soul Key</em> may manifest as an enchanted crystal or token
                        infused
                        with the required soul or spiritual essence.

                        A <em>Trap Rune Lock</em> detonates when tampered with, layering protective runes
                        that
                        require an <em>Arcane Rune Key</em> to disarm. The key itself is often a magical
                        glyph
                        or talisman that matches the runes’ inscription.

                        <strong>Construct Mimic Lock & Password:</strong>
                        The <em>Construct Mimic Lock</em> is a sentient mechanism resembling a lock but
                        requiring
                        a specific password to deactivate. The lock may interact with those attempting to
                        open
                        it, even bargaining or testing them for entry.

                        <strong>Illusionary Lock & Perception:</strong>
                        An <em>Illusionary Lock</em> appears real but is not truly locked. Often, it hides a
                        secondary trap, tricking the unwary into ignoring other dangers. Observant
                        individuals
                        or those skilled in perception can identify it for what it is.

                        <strong>Tech Lock & Code Key:</strong>
                        A <em>Tech Lock</em> incorporates advanced mechanisms such as keypads, fingerprint
                        readers, or voice-activated commands. These locks require a <em>Code Key</em>, which
                        might be a passphrase, biometric data, or a specific tool like a data chip.

                        <strong>Basic Magic Lock & Spell Key:</strong>
                        This lock relies on simple magical energy and requires a basic incantation or a
                        low-power
                        spell to unlock. The <em>Spell Key</em> might be a single word of power or a
                        specific
                        hand motion.

                        <strong>Celestial Lock & Star Key:</strong>
                        A <em>Celestial Lock</em> glimmers with divine light or cosmic energy. It can only be
                        opened with a <em>Star Key</em>, which might take the form of a constellation map, a
                        blessed object, or a mote of starlight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Chaos Lock & Entropy Key:</strong>
                        A swirling, unpredictable <em>Chaos Lock</em> shifts and changes form, preventing
                        easy
                        access. The <em>Entropy Key</em> is equally erratic, requiring a random or illogical
                        approach to use properly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Chronomancy Lock & Temporal Key:</strong>
                        A <em>Chronomancy Lock</em> is bound by time itself, only accessible at specific
                        moments
                        or when manipulated with a <em>Temporal Key</em>, such as a clockwork device or a
                        relic
                        attuned to time magic.

                        <strong>Crystal Lock & Resonance Key:</strong>
                        Crafted from shimmering crystal, the <em>Crystal Lock</em> resonates with specific
                        frequencies. A <em>Resonance Key</em>, often a crystal shard or tuning fork, must
                        match
                        the lock's frequency to open it.

                        <strong>Dragon Lock & Wyrm Key:</strong>
                        Guarded by ancient draconic magic, the <em>Dragon Lock</em> often requires the breath
                        or
                        blood of a dragon to unlock. A <em>Wyrm Key</em> might be a scale, a claw, or a
                        sigil
                        carved in the language of dragons.

                        <strong>Elemental Lock & Element Key:</strong>
                        The <em>Elemental Lock</em> binds its magic to one of the primal forces (fire, water,
                        air, or earth). The <em>Element Key</em> could be a manifestation of the element,
                        such
                        as a flame, a vial of water, or a stone from a sacred place.

                        <strong>Nature Lock & Grove Key:</strong>
                        A <em>Nature Lock</em> thrives with vines, wood, or blooming flowers. It requires a
                        <em>Grove Key</em>, such as a sacred leaf, a druid's token, or a whispered prayer to
                        the
                        forest spirits.

                        <strong>Vozian Lock & Infernal Key:</strong>
                        A dark and malevolent <em>Vozian Lock</em> pulses with infernal energy. It requires
                        an
                        <em>Infernal Key</em>, often a cursed artifact or a pact with an evil entity, to
                        open.

                <h3>Trap Power Levels (PL)</h3>
                <p>Trap PL is a modular system that allows narrators to scale traps for their desired level of
                    danger or challenge. Each PL adds to the damage, range, or complexity of a trap. Use the
                    following guidelines to adapt traps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Traps deal <code>1d6</code> damage per PL (e.g., a PL 2 trap
                        deals
                        <code>2d6</code> damage).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Range:</strong> Trap effects scale by area or target range. A PL 1 trap has a
                        range
                        of 5 ft, increasing by +5 ft per PL. For example, a PL 10 trap would affect a 50 ft
                        radius.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>+Table:</strong> Every 3 PL adds a roll on the +Table for the damage type of the
                        trap. For example, a PL 3 trap would act similarly to a Success+ on a weapon attack,
                        adding
                        effects like conditions or bonus damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disarm:</strong> Traps can typically be disarmed with either a Physical check
                        (e.g.,
                        Agility or Strength) or a Mental check (e.g., Intellect or Spirit), depending on the
                        trap
                        type.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Generic Trap Types</h4>
                <p>Below are common trap concepts for narrators to customize. Apply damage types, conditions, or
                    thematic elements as needed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dart Trap: </strong>A hidden mechanism fires a projectile when triggered. Damage
                        type can be chosen by the narrator (e.g., Toxic, Piercing, Fire).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rune Trap:</strong>
                        Magical symbols activate when disturbed, unleashing effects like explosions, curses, or
                        elemental damage. Narrators can define the damage type (e.g., Fire, Lightning, or
                        Psychic).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trap Door:</strong>
                        A concealed mechanism drops the target into a pit or hazard. Damage type depends on the
                        environment (e.g., Impact, Spikes, or Lava).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Gas Trap:</strong>
                        Releases a harmful cloud when triggered. Narrators can specify conditions (e.g.,
                        Coughing,
                        Poisoned) and damage type (e.g., Toxic or Eclipse).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Net Trap:</strong>
                        Launches a net to immobilize targets, applying the <em>Pinned</em> condition. Narrators
                        can
                        add enhancements like barbs (Piercing damage) or elemental effects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Illusion Trap:</strong>
                        Creates a deceptive or disorienting visual or auditory effect. Can impose conditions
                        like
                        <em>Blind</em>, <em>Confused</em>, or <em>Fear</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Explosive Trap:</strong>
                        Triggers an area-of-effect blast. Damage type can range from Fire to Thunder or even
                        Vozian
                        for infernal-themed traps.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Trap Customization Ideas</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conditions:</strong> Add conditions like <em>Coughing</em>, <em>Prone</em>, or
                        <em>Blinded</em> to enhance the trap’s complexity.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Traps can be triggered by pressure plates, tripwires, magical
                        detection, or proximity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Themes:</strong> Adjust the theme of traps to fit your setting (e.g.,
                        jungle-themed
                        vine traps, steampunk clockwork mechanisms, or infernal traps with cursed effects).</li>

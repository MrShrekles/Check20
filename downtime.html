                    <h2>Merchant: Masters of Downtime</h2>
                    <p>The Merchant class thrives not in battle, but in the spaces between. Downtime is their domain,
                        where
                        they build empires, craft unique goods, and influence the game world through cunning negotiation
                        and
                        resource management. Their impact on the narrative comes from creating opportunities, solving
                        problems with commerce, and shaping the economy around them.</p>

                    <h3>Merchant Conflict Hooks</h3>
                    <p>As a merchant grows in power, their actions may disrupt local economies or provoke powerful
                        factions.
                        Here are potential challenges and hooks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Criminal Syndicates:</strong> A faction sabotages operations with extortion or
                            espionage, targeting trade routes or assets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Merchant Guilds:</strong> Rival merchants or guilds lobby to impose regulations
                            or
                            dismantle monopolies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic Collapse:</strong> Rapid expansion causes market instability, leading
                            to
                            price
                            crashes or resource shortages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rebellion:</strong> Workers or customers revolt against unethical practices,
                            requiring
                            the merchant to address labor disputes or PR crises.</li>
                        <li><strong>Political Intrigue:</strong> Nobles or governing bodies court the merchant for
                            alliances, seeking influence over their wealth and network.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Merchant Reputation System</h3>
                    <p>A merchant’s reputation shapes their interactions with the world, from loyal customers to
                        envious
                        rivals. Reputation can be tracked as a tiered system:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tier 1 (Neutral):</strong> No special bonuses or penalties; standard market
                            interactions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tier 2 (Respected):</strong> Merchants and buyers trust the player, offering
                            minor
                            discounts or favors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tier 3 (Trusted):</strong> Access to restricted markets, exclusive goods, or
                            secret
                            trade deals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tier 4 (Influential):</strong> Political figures or guilds seek alliances;
                            rivals
                            become
                            increasingly hostile.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tier 5 (Legendary):</strong> The merchant becomes a household name, influencing
                            economies, nations, and even world events.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Merchant-Themed Quests</h3>
                    <p>Merchants often drive quests that revolve around their goals or conflicts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Supply Chain Disruption:</strong> Bandits or monsters block a critical trade
                            route,
                            halting business.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hostile Takeover:</strong> A rival attempts to seize control of a merchant’s
                            assets,
                            requiring investigation or sabotage to counter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Black Market Deals:</strong> The merchant must decide whether to engage in risky
                            or
                            illegal trade for immense profits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic War:</strong> Compete against another merchant to dominate a market,
                            leading to
                            intrigue, sabotage, or alliances.</li>
                        <li><strong>Crafting Challenge:</strong> A high-profile client commissions a unique item,
                            requiring
                            rare materials and tight deadlines.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Merchant Role in Party Dynamics</h3>
                    <p>Merchants contribute to their party in diverse ways, emphasizing creativity and
                        collaboration:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Merchants can provide access to rare items,
                            healing
                            potions, or magical gear.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic Leverage:</strong> Their wealth can bribe enemies, fund operations, or
                            sway
                            political outcomes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Connections:</strong> Merchants often have extensive networks, offering
                            the
                            party
                            access to information, favors, or safe havens.</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-Combat Options:</strong> Merchants excel in resolving conflicts through
                            negotiation,
                            trade, or cunning schemes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>Merchant Downtime Activities</h3>
                    <p>During downtime, merchants can engage in activities that enrich the narrative and offer
                        unique
                        gameplay opportunities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Establish new trade routes or expand operations into
                            untapped
                            regions. Success opens up new resources but may draw competition or attention from rival
                            factions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Crafting:</strong> Use skills like alchemy or blacksmithing to create unique
                            items.
                            High-quality or rare goods could attract buyers, leading to side quests or encounters.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> Broker deals, forge alliances, or settle disputes.
                            Successful
                            negotiations might provide discounts, rare materials, or political favor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Invest in goods or businesses to manipulate the economy.
                            Risk-reward scenarios can lead to significant profits—or devastating losses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Projects:</strong> Build facilities like warehouses, workshops,
                            or
                            trade
                            hubs. These structures provide tangible benefits, such as faster crafting or increased
                            inventory
                            capacity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Merchant Intrigue:</strong> Hire spies or informants to gather intel on
                            competitors,
                            governments, or criminal organizations. This information could be leveraged for personal
                            gain or
                            to avoid conflict.</li>
                    </ul>

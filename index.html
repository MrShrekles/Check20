                    <p>Welcome to Check20, a tabletop RPG set in the roaring 1920s, blending high fantasy with the era's
                        charm.
                        Our game focuses on worldbuilding, fast-paced combat, and deep in-world relationships. It values
                        player
                        creativity and group consensus over rigid rules. Survival is key, as characters face real
                        dangers,
                        and
                        not all battles are meant to be fought. Downtime is crucial, especially for roles like merchants
                        needing
                        time for their ventures. The game balances combat with social interactions, where NPCs offer
                        rich
                        stories and potential quests. It's a world where discovery, personal connections, and the thrill
                        of
                        combat coexist, against a backdrop of industrialization and magical mysteries. Players are
                        storytellers,
                        shaping the narrative with their actions in a world full of opportunities and challenges. Engage
                        with
                        the world, from running a jazz club to exploring treacherous lands, and let your imagination
                        guide
                        your
                        journey.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Narrator</h2>
                    <p>Your role is to create the game world, challenge players, and bring the story to life. Encourage
                        player
                        interaction and questions, and reward their achievements with points for character development.
                        Flexibility and adaptation to player actions are key for a dynamic and enjoyable game. Foster
                        creativity
                        and collaboration for a shared adventure.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Players are Characters</h2>
                    <p>Bring your character to life and collaborate with the group towards shared goals. Understand your
                        character's abilities and be proactive in story progression. Think creatively and communicate
                        effectively with the group for a rich, immersive experience.

                    <p>Engage in scenes set by the narrator, incorporating your character's background and goals.
                        Interact
                        with
                        the environment and other characters, guided by the narrator's descriptions. If rules are
                        uncertain,
                        the
                        narrator makes immediate, fair decisions, with adjustments made as needed. Focus on fun and
                        collaborative storytelling for a rewarding experience.

                    <h2>Types of Scenes</h2>
                    <p>There are several types of interactions that players may engage in during the game. These include
                        relationships, mysteries, problems, exploring, combat, and downtime.
                    </p>
                    <div class="features">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Relationships</strong> involve players interacting with characters from their
                                own
                                backstory
                                or with new characters introduced by the narrator. These interactions can lead to
                                intense
                                role-playing and can bring new connections to the group. Creatures and NPCs may have
                                basic
                                or
                                complex needs that players can exploit to gain something in return.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mysteries</strong> and problems are presented by the narrator for the players to
                                solve
                                or
                                interact with. These can range from missing children, bounties, or haunted houses that
                                need
                                to
                                be
                                dealt with. Exploring the world created by the narrator allows players to discover new
                                areas
                                and
                                locations, and can lead to building relationships with local businesses or guilds.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Combat</strong> in this system is brutal, and players should be prepared for
                                tough
                                engagements. It is important to consider conditions and locking out creatures and NPCs
                                from
                                being
                                able to act, rather than relying on hit points. Downtime involves characters recovering
                                from
                                battle
                                and taking care of their equipment, which can lead to further interactions and
                                connections
                                within
                                the city. Finally, character death is something to be expected in combat, but it does
                                not
                                necessarily mean the end of play. The group may consider seeking revival through a
                                temple
                                priest
                                or
                                hospital doctor.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Character Death</strong> is a potential outcome of combat, and players should be
                                prepared
                                for it. However, death is not necessarily the end of play. The group may consider
                                seeking
                                revival
                                through a temple priest or hospital doctor, or may choose to continue the game with a
                                new
                                character.
                                It is important to remember that character death should be taken seriously and not
                                approached
                                with a
                                mindset of always winning
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Downtime</strong> is an important aspect of the game, as it allows characters to
                                recover
                                from battle and tend to their equipment. Repairing armor and interacting with
                                blacksmiths to
                                afford
                                it can lead to further connections within the city and can involve other types of
                                interactions,
                                such
                                as favors or quests. It is important to not take downtime lightly and to consider it as
                                a
                                part
                                of
                                the overall story.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the game, dice, particularly the d20, are used to resolve actions and outcomes. A roll of 15
                        or
                        higher typically signifies success. Actions are categorized by duration, from immediate actions
                        to
                        whole-day tasks. When rolling, players add relevant stats known as Checks to determine outcomes,
                        which
                        range from failure to multiple successes (Success to Success +++) based on the roll. Higher
                        successes
                        may unlock greater effects or damage in combat. Failures present challenges but are not the end,
                        offering narrative depth and problem-solving opportunities.

                        effects as outlined on character sheets.

                        Opportunity attacks can also occur in ranged combat if the creature being attacked has a ranged
                        option
                        immediately available. Opportunity attacks will also trigger if a creature is within another
                        creature's
                        melee attack range and willingly leaves that range without taking the Disengage half-action.

                        Damage calculation starts with armor, then wounds inward unless otherwise specified. Non-d20

                        are
                        used for damage, spells, conditions, and random events, with the narrator providing dice for
                        these
                        specific situations.

                    <p>
                        Critical hits can deal double damage, trigger additional effects, or even instantly defeat foes
                        under
                        specific conditions. Critical failures may result in reduced damage, equipment malfunctions, or
                        other
                        complications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Criticals in Combat:</strong> Critical hits deal double damage, roll an additional time
                        on
                        the
                        damage tables, roll on a random damage table, or instantly kill the creature if they are near
                        death

                    <p>
                        <strong>Critical Failure:</strong> On a critical failure but still a hit, it should deal half
                        damage, or
                        the weapon could break, fall out of their hands, or create another complication on the
                        battlefield.
                        Perhaps the spell deals damage back or fails. A critical failure should not equal a success, but
                        a
                        creature with a +15 in a check should never really fail.

                    <p>
                        In the game, checks dictate how your character interacts with the world and faces challenges. At
                        the
                        start, you're given 20 points to spread among these checks, but no check can receive more than
                        10 points
                        from this initial pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Math:</strong> When you roll a 20-sided die (d20), each outcome has a 5%
                        probability. The
                        average roll is 10.5, meaning there's a 50% likelihood of rolling 10 or above. Adding modifiers,
                        like a
                        +5 bonus, shifts the average roll to 15.5, enhancing your chances of superior results. As you
                        move up
                        the scale (15-34), outcomes improve, leading to better achievements in combat or surpassing
                        original
                        goals.

                    <h3>Minimum Wounds</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your wounds are equal to your Agility + Strength checks. If you put points into Agility or
                        Strength, it
                        increases your wounds by that much. If you do not have any points in either, you have a minimum
                        of 1. If
                        you put 1 into one of the checks, it would still be 1 until you raise it above the minimum.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Low Light Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                        In dark places where all you have is a torch or a flashlight, you use the low light vision stat.
                        Unless
                        otherwise stated, creatures cannot see in complete darkness. <br>

                        is in the gym training or perhaps in the library rounding out their skills.

                        be 9
                        months:

                    <p>
                        Emphasize to players the significance of full devotion in their training regimen. It's an

                        for rich role-play, exploring the struggles and triumphs that define their character's growth.
                        While
                        occasional minor tasks are part of their routine, their narrative should be dominated by intense
                        and
                        purposeful training, shaping their journey towards greatness.

                    <h2>Loyalty</h2>
                    <p>
                        Loyalty not only measures individual trust and bonds but also reflects a character's reputation
                        within
                        factions or guilds, impacted by their actions and decisions. Positive deeds like completing
                        quests or
                        offering gifts enhance loyalty, while negative actions such as betrayal diminish it. This system
                        includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Individual Loyalty:</strong> Loyalty between characters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Group Reputation:</strong> A character's standing with factions or guilds changes
                            based on
                            their actions, affecting interactions and opportunities within those groups.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Loyalty points are earned or lost through these actions, dictating the character's relationship
                        and
                        standing within the community. Tiers range from Hostile to Unwavering to represent the depth of
                        trust or
                        disdain. Loyalty Checks, influenced by these points or the character's tier within the faction
                        or guild,
                        are pivotal in social encounters, leading to outcomes such as gaining access to unique
                        resources, facing
                        hostility, or unlocking special quests.

                        Combat simplifies to a clash between your party and enemies, initiating with an attack and
                        proceeding in
                        turn-based rounds, where strategy aims to incapacitate opponents akin to chess's checkmate,
                        either
                        through
                        strategic disadvantage or elimination. Consideration for peaceful resolutions or stealth
                        approaches
                        can enrich
                        the roleplaying experience.

                        Morale checks for enemies can dictate their willingness to fight, with
                        living beings
                        more likely to flee than undead.
                        Turn order is determined by an initiative roll, which is a roll +
                        Agility check, proceeding until one side wins or retreats. Actions can be delayed for strategic
                        timing within one's
                        turn, maintaining the chosen initiative position.

                    <h3>Character Health</h3>
                    <p>
                        Character health in this RPG pivots from traditional hit points to a system of armor and wounds
                        for a grittier
                        feel. Damage hits armor first, then wounds. Zero wounds result in being in the Injured Condition
                        and further
                        damage risks the Death condition.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Armor acts as your first defense, absorbing damage until depleted, then requires repairs.
                            Some spells boost
                            armor temporarily.</li>
                        <li>Wounds track minor injuries, healed by rest or medical aid. Exhausting wound capacity leads
                            to the Injured
                            condition; additional harm may cause death. Wound capacity is the sum of Agility and
                            Strength checks.</li>
                        <li>Healing replenishes wounds up to the character's maximum, not affecting armor or directly
                            curing conditions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Press On</h3>
                    <p>
                        After a combat encounter, characters can "Press On" to regain 1 class resource, 1 spell point,
                        repair armor for
                        <code>[[1d6]]</code> + Crafting, heal for <code>[[1d6]]</code> + Survival, and remove all
                        conditions and effects lasting
                        for 1 minute or
                        less. This option can be used twice per day, but not consecutively without engaging in another
                        combat.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Long Rest</h3>
                    <p>
                        A long rest requires 10 hours of uninterrupted downtime, fully restoring all wounds, recharging
                        class resources,
                        repairing all armor to at least half, and removing any conditions that last one day or less.
                        Characters can only
                        take a long rest once per long rest and must be in a safe environment.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Move:</strong> Utilize your speed and terrain to reposition, dodge, or engage.
                            Movement can be split
                            before and after your action as needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Action:</strong> The primary activity you perform, like attacking or casting a
                            spell. Generally, you
                            get one action per turn, though certain abilities may offer more.</li>
                        <li><strong>Half-Actions:</strong> Smaller actions that can be doubled up in place of a full
                            action, such as
                            shooting and reloading a weapon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Off-Action:</strong> Can be used to attack on your turn or react off your turn to a
                            missed attack.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Free-Action:</strong> Minor tasks or communication that don't consume your action
                            economy, like quick
                            exchanges or item handling.</li>

                    <h3>Combat and Non-Combat Mechanics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Finisher</strong>: This rule lets characters end a fight quickly if they attack
                            unseen, if their foe can't fight back,
                            or is caught off guard. A successful stealth check can confirm a silent, instant defeat,
                            regardless of the
                            enemy's remaining health. This option is ideal when facing a lone, defenseless target or an
                            unsuspecting one
                            in a vulnerable state, such as sleeping without guards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Targeting</strong>: To attack, you must see, hear, or otherwise detect your target.
                            Lack of senses may impose
                            disadvantages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cover</strong>: Targets behind half cover are at disadvantage to hit; targets behind
                            full cover cannot be targeted.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Surprise Turns</strong>: Attacking from stealth can grant an extra turn. Reveals the
                            attacker's position unless
                            abilities say otherwise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Called Shots</strong>: Aim for specific effects rather than damage. Declare before
                            attacking, accept a -10 to hit, and
                            if successful, inflict conditions like Bleeding, Broken, or Blind, instead of normal damage.
                        </li>

                    <h2>Movement</h2>
                    <p>
                        In combat, movement is a separate type of action from attacking or using items. During any turn
                        in combat, you
                        can move any amount of your movement speed at any point during your turn. For example, if you
                        have 30 ft of
                        movement, you can move 10 ft to approach a creature, attack, and then move 20 ft away. However,
                        if you engage a
                        creature in combat and then retreat, they may have an opportunity to attack you using their
                        Off-Action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Fern-Tuft (ft) Definition:</strong> In this rulebook, "ft" does not stand for "feet" but
                        for
                        "fern-tuft," a unit of measure slightly smaller than the traditional foot. This ensures that
                        when a character
                        moves 50ft in a turn, the distance is more practical within the game's context. For ease, simply
                        use "ferns" to
                        refer to this unit of measurement in gameplay.

                    <h3>Types of Movement</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Difficult Terrain:</strong> Requires twice as much movement to navigate, so every 5
                            ft becomes

                    Damage & Damage Types
                </summary>
                <p>In the world of Shek, numerous damage types exist, each with unique properties and effects. When a
                    character rolls a success+ or greater with a weapon or spell, they have the opportunity to roll on
                    the associated damage table, leading to a variety of outcomes. Here's an overview of the damage
                    types and their potential interactions with armor, wounds, and injuries:
                    These are organized by physical, elemental, and Realm Damage types. These are in each category not
                    because of the amount of damage they do but what conditions and effects they cause on their damage
                    tables. physical damage will often just deal additional damage while Realm Damage can cause
                    immediate injuries or banish creatures to alternate planes momentarily.
                    If an ability, weapon, gear, spell or whatever says it deals physical damage, it means a physical
                    damage type of your choice. Same thing if it says elemental or realm. If you are given a choice at
                    the time of creation of an item that usually means that item is locked into that damage type, unless
                    you and the narrator determine that it is a shifting item or if it says so in the description.
                    A weapon can only have one type of damage. If you have abilities that add damage to a weapon, spell
                    or ability then it adds that on and doesn't change the type unless otherwise specified. A glyph can
                    change the type of damage on a weapon. When you make a check with multiple successes then the
                    weapon’s damage type is used, not the additional damage types.

                                    basic padlocks to more complex tumbler mechanisms. These locks are susceptible to
                                    lockpicking or brute force.</p>

                                <p>A <em>Blood Lock</em> requires the touch of blood to open. Depending on the
                                    difficulty,
                                    it might require the blood of a specific creature, a creature type, or just any

                                    blood. A <em>Blood Key</em> often takes the form of a dagger-like object that
                                    requires a
                                    cut to activate, channeling the essence of the wielder into the lock.</p>

                        <h3>Trap Power Levels (PL)</h3>
                        <p>Trap PL is a modular system that allows narrators to scale traps for their desired level of
                            danger or challenge. Each PL adds to the damage, range, or complexity of a trap. Use the
                            following guidelines to adapt traps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Traps deal <code>1d6</code> damage per PL (e.g., a PL 2 trap
                                deals
                                <code>2d6</code> damage).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Range:</strong> Trap effects scale by area or target range. A PL 1 trap has a
                                range
                                of 5 ft, increasing by +5 ft per PL. For example, a PL 10 trap would affect a 50 ft
                                radius.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>+Table:</strong> Every 3 PL adds a roll on the +Table for the damage type of the
                                trap. For example, a PL 3 trap would act similarly to a Success+ on a weapon attack,
                                adding
                                effects like conditions or bonus damage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disarm:</strong> Traps can typically be disarmed with either a Physical check
                                (e.g.,
                                Agility or Strength) or a Mental check (e.g., Intellect or Spirit), depending on the
                                trap
                                type.</li>

                                elemental damage. Narrators can define the damage type (e.g., Fire, Lightning, or
                                Psychic).

                                A concealed mechanism drops the target into a pit or hazard. Damage type depends on the
                                environment (e.g., Impact, Spikes, or Lava).

                                Releases a harmful cloud when triggered. Narrators can specify conditions (e.g.,
                                Coughing,
                                Poisoned) and damage type (e.g., Toxic or Eclipse).

                                Launches a net to immobilize targets, applying the <em>Pinned</em> condition. Narrators
                                can
                                add enhancements like barbs (Piercing damage) or elemental effects.

                                Triggers an area-of-effect blast. Damage type can range from Fire to Thunder or even
                                Vozian
                                for infernal-themed traps.

                    <p>The Merchant class thrives not in battle, but in the spaces between. Downtime is their domain,
                        where

                        and
                        resource management. Their impact on the narrative comes from creating opportunities, solving
                        problems with commerce, and shaping the economy around them.</p>

                                dismantle monopolies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Economic Collapse:</strong> Rapid expansion causes market instability, leading
                                to
                                price
                                crashes or resource shortages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rebellion:</strong> Workers or customers revolt against unethical practices,

                        <h3>Merchant Downtime Activities</h3>
                        <p>During downtime, merchants can engage in activities that enrich the narrative and offer
                            unique
                            gameplay opportunities:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Establish new trade routes or expand operations into
                                untapped
                                regions. Success opens up new resources but may draw competition or attention from rival
                                factions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Crafting:</strong> Use skills like alchemy or blacksmithing to create unique
                                items.
                                High-quality or rare goods could attract buyers, leading to side quests or encounters.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> Broker deals, forge alliances, or settle disputes.
                                Successful
                                negotiations might provide discounts, rare materials, or political favor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Invest in goods or businesses to manipulate the economy.
                                Risk-reward scenarios can lead to significant profits—or devastating losses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infrastructure Projects:</strong> Build facilities like warehouses, workshops,
                                or
                                trade
                                hubs. These structures provide tangible benefits, such as faster crafting or increased
                                inventory
                                capacity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Merchant Intrigue:</strong> Hire spies or informants to gather intel on
                                competitors,
                                governments, or criminal organizations. This information could be leveraged for personal
                                gain or
                                to avoid conflict.</li>

            <h1>Damage Tables</h1>
            <p>When you roll a 20 or above on damage, this is termed a "success+". For every "success+" you achieve,
                you're
                granted a roll on the appropriate damage table specific to your weapon. Every 5 above 20 is an
                additional
                success+, so 25 would be 2 rolls, and 30 would be 3. It's vital to remember that different weapons come
                with
                distinct damage tables, so strategic weapon selection can offer unique advantages in combat.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Repeated Conditions</strong>: When you have a repeated, non-stacking condition you deal +1 damage
                instead</p>
            <h3>Special Values</h3>
            <li><strong>Cleave</strong>: deal the half damage to any other targetted creatures within melee range</li>
            <li><strong>Siphon</strong>: heal for the amount listed</li>

                <h2>Spellcasting</h2>
                <p>
                    In the intricate dance of spellcasting, every movement and utterance matters. A mage must channel
                    their intentions through voice and gesture, like a maestro guiding an orchestra. Yet, magic demands
                    clarity. If a caster finds themselves silenced or restrained, the symphony of magic halts. Even
                    their gear plays a role; while hands must be free as the wind, a shield may hinder, and armor can
                    stifle the very currents of magic they seek to harness.
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Spellcasting requires voice and gesture. Restraints or
                            silence hinders magic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Casting:</strong> Make a Spellcasting check. If you lack a specific Spellcasting
                            check, use a Spirit check. Spells generally require an action to cast or double the spell
                            points for half-actions or off-actions. Add +1 to no-cast spells.</li>
                        <li><strong>Targeting:</strong> Requires sensory perception of the target.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spell Points:</strong> Recover 1 when you press on and all on a long rest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Requires a minimum Spirit check of 2, granting 1 spell
                            point.</li>

                    <h3>Spell Calculation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some spellcasters prefer to calculate the true cost of a spell to develop a stronger connection
                        with their magic. The intent system is fine, but they want precise control. Here are the tables
                        and information for spell calculation.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Spells vs. Abilities -->
                    <h4>Spells vs. Abilities</h4>
                    <p>
                        All magical effects aren't created equal. While some creatures are innately resistant or immune
                        to certain spells, they might still be susceptible to others, depending on their inherent
                        magical defenses or capabilities. The distinction between what constitutes a spell and what
                        doesn't often lies in the essence of its origin.
                        <br>
                        For instance, a hag's enchantment or a lich's spell is undeniably magical. Conversely, a
                        dragon's fiery breath or the enchantment of a magical sword isn't necessarily a "spell." It's
                        crucial for the Narrator to discern these differences, tailoring their decisions to the
                        situation at hand.

                    <h4>Spellcasting Notes</h4>
                    <h5>Death Condition in Dynamic Magic</h5>
                    <p>
                        To impose the death condition via spellcasting, a significant investment of spell points is
                        required. Costs are determined by the combination of high-cost Manner and Transmission words.
                        Upon casting, the afflicted target can attempt a survival check to resist the spell's effects on
                        their turn. Success depends on the difficulty set by the Narrator, potentially influenced by the
                        target's attributes or the spell's strength.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of the death condition spell is carefully regulated by the Narrator to maintain balance
                        and narrative tension, particularly during pivotal encounters. It should not be a trivial or
                        dominant strategy but a deliberate choice with appropriate risks and costs. The death condition
                        may also result from zero wounds, subsequent injury, and further damage, creating a layered
                        approach to combat and spellcasting consequences.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Spell Duration -->
                    <h4>How Long a Magic Condition Lasts</h4>
                    <p>
                        In Dynamic Magic, spell duration is influenced by the nature of the spell and the caster's
                        intent. Temporary spells, like those causing prone or pinned conditions, last until the target
                        counters them, such as standing up or making a strength check. These spells can become a battle
                        of wills, with the caster needing to concentrate to maintain their effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More severe spells, like those causing broken bones, have longer-lasting impacts that require
                        medical or magical healing. Permanent spells, like those altering terrain or creating objects,
                        remain without ongoing caster focus. Spell duration reflects the caster's purpose, the spell's
                        character, and the balance within the magical world, with some spells easily countered and
                        others leaving lasting effects.

                        <li><strong>Strength-Based Weapons:</strong> Heavy and powerful weapons like hammers and
                            broadswords, requiring brute force for impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agility-Based Weapons:</strong> Lightweight weapons like daggers, rapiers, and bows,
                            relying on finesse and precision.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standard Weapons:</strong> Basic and simple weapons that can be wielded with either
                            Strength or Agility.</li>

                            Firearms are rare and powerful tools in our world, often viewed with suspicion due to their
                            potential for destruction. Most cities and populated areas regulate or even ban their use.
                            Carrying a firearm openly attracts attention, especially from law enforcement or bandits.
                            While
                            firearms provide immense firepower, they come with risks and consequences. If you choose to
                            wield one, do so wisely and carefully.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When adventuring, armor is your primary line of defense. It's essential to ally with a
                            blacksmith who can repair and upgrade your gear. In combat, armor absorbs hits before they
                            affect your health. Remember, armor is not destroyed when its protection points are
                            depleted; it
                            simply can't offer protection until repaired.

                            Armor also shields against poison, as venom requires direct contact with the skin to be
                            effective. Be cautious, as wearing too much heavy gear can impose the 'pinned' condition,
                            hindering your movement.

                        <p>
                            Bulk represents the weight and space your gear occupies, from negligible trinkets to
                            burdensome
                            hauls. It's not just about weight but also the size and how cumbersome an item is. Managing
                            your
                            bulk is crucial for maintaining agility and avoiding encumbrance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, a watch has 0 Bulk because it can be worn and forgotten about. Meanwhile, an
                            empty
                            barrel may be light but is awkward to carry, giving it a Bulk of 5.

                    <h2>Crafting</h2>
                    <p>In the world of Shek, crafting armor and weapons requires a Forge Workbench, materials (purchased
                        or
                        scavenged), and skilled hands. Existing mundane items can also be repurposed into new items,
                        such as
                        converting heavy armor into medium armor or reshaping medium armor into a weapon.</p>

                    <h3>Forge Workbench</h3>
                    <p>A Forge Workbench is essential for crafting and includes a main station where the crafter makes
                        their
                        Crafting check. Up to three allies can assist the main crafter using different workstations,
                        each
                        contributing with their skills.</p>

                        <li><strong>Making Checks:</strong> The main crafter and allies at workstations each make their
                            respective checks. The total number of successes determines the item’s quality.</li>

                        <h2>Glyphs</h2>
                        <p>Glyphs are powerful symbols infused with magic, capable of granting weapons, armor, and even
                            characters with remarkable abilities and enhancements. Through glyphs, a simple piece of
                            gear
                            can become a legendary artifact, and a character may access abilities that significantly
                            alter
                            their role and capabilities within the game.</p>

                        <h3>Crafting and Application</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Crafting and applying glyphs require specific materials
                                and
                                a suitable crafting station, such as an enchanting table or magical lab. The rarity of
                                materials and quality of the station can affect the outcome.</li>
                            <li><strong>Crafting Process:</strong> Crafters must perform Crafting, Intellect, Spirit, or
                                other related checks. The complexity of the glyph determines the number of successes
                                required.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Process:</strong> Applying a glyph involves a similar check to
                                integrate
                                the glyph's magical essence fully. Each step takes one hour, with more complex glyphs
                                requiring additional time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Risk of Failure:</strong> Failed crafting or application checks can damage or
                                destroy the item, with consequences scaling based on the severity of the failure.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Curses</h2>
                <p>Curses add an exciting layer of strategy, tension, depth, and complexity to gameplay. By placing a
                    curse on a character or item, players must weigh the risk versus reward of using it or benefiting
                    from the curse's effects. While curses can grant powerful abilities or bonuses, they often come with
                    significant drawbacks, creating a dynamic gameplay experience. Curses are not always malicious; they
                    can stem from angels, tech lords, or other sources, adding an element of unpredictability and
                    customization to the game.</p>

                <h3>Curse Progression</h3>
                <p>Curses work similarly to Paths and Talents. Players can spend XP to gain features from a curse, often
                    at a steep cost. Some curses require players to acquire bane features before unlocking powerful
                    boons. Curses offer a blend of complexity and customization, allowing characters to evolve uniquely.

                                <li><strong>Branded By Words:</strong> Your body is marked by glowing scripts of ancient
                                    languages, creating discomfort and distraction. However, these scripts faintly
                                    illuminate the area around you, providing a soft light in darkness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lingering Echo:</strong> Every spell you cast leaves an echo in your voice
                                    for a short time, revealing your spellcasting to those who can interpret it. On the
                                    flip side, your understanding of spell echoes sharpens, granting advantage on Arcana
                                    checks related to identifying spells.</li>
                                <li><strong>Wordbound:</strong> Each spell inscribed on your body pulses with power when
                                    a corresponding spell is cast nearby, causing discomfort but alerting you to the use
                                    of that particular spell within a radius of 60 ft.</li>

                                    they start to strengthen your defenses, granting you additional armor equal to the
                                    number of spell words inscribed on you.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scripted Senses:</strong> Your senses become magically heightened, allowing

                                <li><strong>Words of Power:</strong> The inscriptions start to resonate with your own
                                    magic. When you cast a spell that matches an inscription on your body, its potency
                                    increases, adding a bonus to the damage or healing amount.</li>
                                <li><strong>Woven Words:</strong> You can draw power from your inscriptions to cast
                                    spells without expending spell points. once per long rest, you can cast a spell that
                                    matches an inscription on your body for free.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inscribed Protection:</strong> The power of the inscriptions reaches its
                                    peak, creating a barrier around you. You gain immunity to one damage type of a spell
                                    inscribed on your body.</li>
                                <li><strong>Echoing Shield:</strong> Your inscriptions pulse with power whenever a spell
                                    targets you. As a reaction, gain immunity to damage from spells until the end of
                                    your next turn.</li>
                                <li><strong>Word Ascendancy:</strong> You and your inscriptions become one. The words
                                    covering your body shine brilliantly, and your eyes glow with arcane power. You gain
                                    immunity to all spell damage and the ability to cast a spell inscribed on your body

                        <h2>Technomancer's Oath</h2>
                        <p>The allure of combining arcane magic and technological prowess has enticed you down a
                            dangerous path. Bit by bit, your body is replaced with machinery, your consciousness
                            intertwined with arcane energies and electronic impulses. With each step, the boundary
                            between the physical and digital, the magical and mechanical, blurs.</p>

                        <div class="features">
                            <h4>Curse Progression</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Cybernetic Symbiosis:</strong> Your limbs begin to be replaced by
                                    arcane-imbued technology. Gain advantage on Strength or Agility checks relying on
                                    the replaced limbs. However, take double damage from Lightning damage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Arcane Processor:</strong> A portion of your brain is replaced by a
                                    magic-tech processor. Gain advantage on Intellect and Observation checks, but
                                    exposure to powerful magic or Lightning damage gives you the confused condition for
                                    1 minute.</li>
                                <li><strong>Optical Enhancement:</strong> Your eyes are replaced with advanced optical
                                    sensors. See in dim light as if it were bright light and in complete darkness as if
                                    it were dim light. You can zoom to see far distances. However, flash bangs and
                                    sudden bright magical lights can blind you for 1 minute.</li>
                                <li><strong>Aetheric Heart:</strong> Your heart is replaced with a magical-tech reactor,
                                    removing the need for food and sleep. Gain resistance to poison and disease, but
                                    you're more susceptible to magic drain or anti-magic fields, which cause a random
                                    condition (2) from the table below for 1 minute.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mechano-Magical Network:</strong> Your nervous system is upgraded,
                                    heightening reflexes and magical interaction. Remove the negative effects from the
                                    previous progression steps.</li>

                                <h4>Greater Progression</h4>
                                <p>As you dive deeper into the mysteries of technomancy, the lines blur further. You are
                                    neither fully organic nor fully mechanical, but something new - an embodiment of
                                    magic and machine intertwined. Each upgrade strengthens your control over technology
                                    and magic, granting you unprecedented abilities. However, these steps also mark the
                                    increasing disconnect between your current self and your past humanity, with
                                    vulnerabilities rooted in your dual nature. Harnessing the full potential of this
                                    path may lead to unprecedented power or a profound existential crisis, and it's up
                                    to you to navigate this treacherous journey.</p>
                                <li><strong>Integrated Arcane Arsenal:</strong> Integrate magical weapons into your
                                    mechanized body parts. These weapons can be summoned and dismissed at will.</li>
                                <li><strong>Spectral Firewall:</strong> As a half-action, create a protective arcane
                                    shield around you that prevents the next source of damage until the end of your next
                                    turn.</li>
                                <li><strong>Digital Consciousness:</strong> Upload your consciousness into digital
                                    devices, cybernetics, constructs, or anything else with a tech-magic center. If you
                                    are more powerful, you can overtake or upgrade the device and take control.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mananite Restoration:</strong> Mananites circulate through your body,
                                    rapidly repairing physical damage. Heal 1 hit point every minute and 1 injury every
                                    hour.</li>
                                <li><strong>Singularity Ascension:</strong> Your transformation reaches its zenith as
                                    you become an entity of pure techno-magical energy. Gain the ability to control and
                                    shape arcane-tech devices in your vicinity, but the stability of your new form
                                    heavily relies on the availability of arcane and technological resources.</li>

                    <p>The touch of the damned leaves more than a physical scar; it marks the soul. Infernal Skritches
                        is a potent affliction transmitted through the rending claws and gnashing teeth of true demons.
                        This curse burns away mortal flesh, replacing it with the accursed essence of the abyss.</p>

                            <li><strong>Festering Wound:</strong> The wound festers and burns. Each time the afflicted
                                takes damage, they gain another Infernal wound. Infernal magic becomes more potent, but

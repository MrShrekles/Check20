        <p class="faint">I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to Troll, Builder, Knightstar, Kilian, Chris, Sam, and
            Aaron for all
            their hard work and dedication in helping me create an enjoyable TTRPG experience. Your creativity and
            willingness to collaborate made the process so much more enjoyable and the final outcome truly exceeded my
            expectations. Thank you for being a part of this journey and for all the laughter, ideas and support. I
            couldn't have done it without you.

            Check20 is an original tabletop role-playing game system created by me, Mr. Shrekles. Any similarities or
            resemblance to existing game systems, mechanics, or content is purely coincidental and unintentional. We
            have strived to create a unique and enjoyable gaming experience with Check20 while still providing a
            familiar feel for RPG enthusiasts. However, if any similarities or overlaps are found, please know that they
            were not intended and we apologize for any confusion. Thank you for choosing Check20 as your gaming system
            of choice.

            <h1>Enchanted items</h1>
            <p>
                You may find in your adventures and mysteries items that have been enchanted or crafted with special
                power. Each one carries a story. What force was used to forge it? Who created it? A forgotten mage, a
                desperate soul, or something older? And for what purpose: protection, vengeance, or something darker?
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike standard gear, these relics may evolve, whisper secrets, or alter fate itself. Some resonate with
                specific users. Others demand sacrifice or influence your dreams. They might be remnants of fallen gods,
                cursed inventions, or soul-bound curiosities that grow as you do. Every enchanted item is a piece of the
                world, and the more you learn about it, the more it might learn about you.

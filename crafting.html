            <h2>Weapon & Armor Crafting</h2>
            <p>In the world of Shek, crafting armor and weapons requires a Forge Workbench, materials (purchased
                or
                scavenged), and skilled hands. Existing mundane items can also be repurposed into new items,
                such as
                converting heavy armor into medium armor or reshaping medium armor into a weapon.</p>

            <h3>Forge Workbench</h3>
            <p>A Forge Workbench is essential for crafting and includes a main station where the crafter makes
                their
                Crafting check. Up to three allies can assist the main crafter using different workstations,
                each
                contributing with their skills.</p>

            <h3>Crafting Process</h3>
            <p>Crafting armor or weapons is a collaborative process requiring time, effort, and teamwork:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crafting Time:</strong> A long downtime or long rest in a safe place with a Forge
                    Workbench.</li>
                <li><strong>Making Checks:</strong> The main crafter and allies at workstations each make their
                    respective checks. The total number of successes determines the item‚Äôs quality.</li>

                other
                specialized workstations. Each station focuses on different aspects of firearm and

                <h2>Glyphs</h2>
                <p>Glyphs are powerful symbols infused with magic, capable of granting weapons, armor, and even
                    characters with remarkable abilities and enhancements. Through glyphs, a simple piece of
                    gear
                    can become a legendary artifact, and a character may access abilities that significantly
                    alter
                    their role and capabilities within the game.</p>

                <h3>Crafting and Application</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Crafting and applying glyphs require specific materials
                        and
                        a suitable crafting station, such as an enchanting table or magical lab. The rarity of
                        materials and quality of the station can affect the outcome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crafting Process:</strong> Crafters must perform Crafting, Intellect, Spirit, or
                        other related checks. The complexity of the glyph determines the number of successes
                        required.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application Process:</strong> Applying a glyph involves a similar check to
                        integrate
                        the glyph's magical essence fully. Each step takes one hour, with more complex glyphs
                        requiring additional time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Failure:</strong> Failed crafting or application checks can damage or
                        destroy the item, with consequences scaling based on the severity of the failure.</li>
                </ul>

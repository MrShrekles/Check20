                    <!-- Intro  -->
                    <p>Welcome to Check20, a tabletop RPG set in the roaring 1920s, blending high fantasy with the era's
                        charm.
                        Our game focuses on worldbuilding, fast-paced combat, and deep in-world relationships. It values
                        player
                        creativity and group consensus over rigid rules. Survival is key, as characters face real
                        dangers,
                        and
                        not all battles are meant to be fought. Downtime is crucial, especially for roles like merchants
                        needing
                        time for their ventures. The game balances combat with social interactions, where NPCs offer
                        rich
                        stories and potential quests. It's a world where discovery, personal connections, and the thrill
                        of
                        combat coexist, against a backdrop of industrialization and magical mysteries. Players are
                        storytellers,
                        shaping the narrative with their actions in a world full of opportunities and challenges. Engage
                        with
                        the world, from running a jazz club to exploring treacherous lands, and let your imagination
                        guide
                        your
                        journey.

                    <h1>How To Play</h1>
                    <p>
                        Gather a group of friends or like-minded folks who enjoy building stories together.
                        I have created (and will keep creating) tools to make running this game easier.
                        You can play online using Roll20, or go full classic with pencils and paper.
                        Character creation is available on the website, but making your own sheets by hand
                        is always an option.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A game system exists to give structure, rules that create challenges and focus.
                        Yes, everything is made up anyway, but having a framework makes the fun funner.
                        Pure improv can be great, but having mechanics gives you tension, consequences,
                        and those big triumphant moments that feel earned.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once you have gathered your people, they will make characters while you prepare the world.
                        Listen to what they choose and shape the story around them. If someone is a tank, think of
                        intense fights and a big boss battle. If someone is a mage, maybe there is a rival
                        spellcaster, a wise mentor, or a magic school down the street. If someone is a merchant,
                        break out some spreadsheets and prepare for the weirdest and most unpredictable corner of
                        this system, a corner even I am still figuring out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Players choose a Class, then a Path and Talent for that Class. Before or after that they
                        pick a Species. Your world determines whether species are high fantasy or low fantasy.
                        In high fantasy, everyone might be wildly unique creatures. In low fantasy, everyone is
                        basically human with one cool feature, like an orc who is just a dude with modest tusks,
                        or a helborn who looks normal except their irises burn like embers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Low fantasy makes high fantasy moments feel even bigger. But I almost always run high
                        fantasy because it is fun to let players be happy. And after a dozen campaigns, who
                        wants to be just a knight when you can be a plaguebringer half angel with a penchant
                        for mysteries.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now the Narrator sets the scene. How do these characters fit in? Are they a band of
                        oddballs sitting in a smoky bar, low lights and even lower inhibitions? Are they a
                        mystery solving crew sharing an apartment downtown? In Shek, the world is dangerous
                        and alive with possibility. Even a simple trip to Target (which existed in the 1920s,
                        trust me on this) can turn into a battle with a sewer construct, yes a creature built
                        from the sewer itself. The drain mouth rises up, pipes twisting like a serpent, and
                        you grin as you ask,
                    </p>

                            <p>
                                When a player rolls a Success + or higher, the result should feel bigger than a simple pass. Most checks have more
                                than one way to succeed, so higher success tiers create stronger outcomes, better advantages, or more cinematic
                                impact. Your job as the Narrator is to reward great rolls with great moments.

                                <strong>Example: Breaking Down a Door</strong><br>
                                A Success means the door breaks open. A Success + might have the door fly off its hinges. A Success ++ could send
                                the door crashing into a guard on the other side for 1d6 impact damage. A Success +++ might reveal crucial intel
                                or catch enemies completely unaware. Bigger success should equal bigger results.

                                When the whole party attempts the same action, such as sneaking past a patrol or pushing a truck out of the road,
                                you can call for a Group Check. The group must reach a number of total successes equal to the number of players
                                taking part. For example, a group of four characters needs four total successes to slip by undetected. Even if two
                                players fail, the stealth expert might roll a Success +++ while another hits a clean success, bringing the group
                                across the finish line together.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                <strong>Setting Difficulty</strong><br>
                                The number of required successes changes how hard a task is. Something ordinary should not require a roll at all.
                                If a character can reasonably do the task, simply call it a success. For typical challenges a single success at
                                15 is all they need. Larger obstacles may require Success + or even multiple successes to show that the task is
                                significant. This lets you scale difficulty without changing the core target number.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Success + outcomes create memorable scenes and empower players to shape the story. Failure and success both move
                                the narrative forward, but greater successes let the players shine.

                            <p>
                                Critical checks are the extremes of a d20 roll. A critical success can supercharge an action, while a critical failure adds
                                complications. This applies to all checks, not just attacks.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                <strong>Critical Success:</strong> On a critical success, the effect of the action should be stronger or cleaner than normal.
                                In combat this can mean double damage, an extra roll on a damage table, a bonus effect, or even finishing off a creature
                                that is already near defeat and the situation makes sense. Outside combat it might mean perfect timing, extra information,
                                or a stronger narrative outcome.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                <strong>Critical Failure:</strong> On a critical failure, something goes wrong. In combat this might mean half damage,
                                a weapon slipping, breaking, or creating a new problem on the battlefield. A spell might backfire, fizzle, or cause
                                unintended side effects. A critical failure should never feel like a clean success, but creatures with very high Checks
                                should rarely fall completely flat. For them, treat critical failures more as setbacks and complications than total collapse.

                        In this game, dice are used to see what happens when you try something risky, with the d20 doing most of the heavy lifting. In most situations, a roll of 15 or higher is considered a success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you roll, you add a relevant stat called a Check to your result. That total lands on a tier that ranges from
                        Failure up to Success +++, with higher successes unlocking stronger effects, extra damage, or bonus advantages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actions come in different durations, from quick reactions to tasks that can take the whole day. Even when you fail,
                        it is not the end of the story. Failure creates complications, twists, and new problems to solve, instead of simply
                        stopping the game.

                        <h2>Types of Scenes</h2>
                        <p>There are several types of interactions that players may engage in during the game. These include relationships, mysteries, problems, exploring, combat, and downtime.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Relationships</strong> involve players interacting with characters from their
                                own
                                backstory
                                or with new characters introduced by the narrator. These interactions can lead to
                                intense
                                role-playing and can bring new connections to the group. Creatures and NPCs may have
                                basic
                                or
                                complex needs that players can exploit to gain something in return.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mysteries</strong> and problems are presented by the narrator for the players to
                                solve
                                or
                                interact with. These can range from missing children, bounties, or haunted houses that
                                need
                                to
                                be
                                dealt with. Exploring the world created by the narrator allows players to discover new
                                areas
                                and
                                locations, and can lead to building relationships with local businesses or guilds.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Combat</strong> in this system is brutal, and players should be prepared for
                                tough
                                engagements. It is important to consider conditions and locking out creatures and NPCs
                                from
                                being
                                able to act, rather than relying on hit points. Downtime involves characters recovering
                                from
                                battle
                                and taking care of their equipment, which can lead to further interactions and
                                connections
                                within
                                the city. Finally, character death is something to be expected in combat, but it does
                                not
                                necessarily mean the end of play. The group may consider seeking revival through a
                                temple
                                priest
                                or
                                hospital doctor.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Character Death</strong> is a potential outcome of combat, and players should be
                                prepared
                                for it. However, death is not necessarily the end of play. The group may consider
                                seeking
                                revival
                                through a temple priest or hospital doctor, or may choose to continue the game with a
                                new
                                character.
                                It is important to remember that character death should be taken seriously and not
                                approached
                                with a
                                mindset of always winning
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Downtime</strong> is an important aspect of the game, as it allows characters to
                                recover
                                from battle and tend to their equipment. Repairing armor and interacting with
                                blacksmiths to
                                afford
                                it can lead to further connections within the city and can involve other types of
                                interactions,
                                such
                                as favors or quests. It is important to not take downtime lightly and to consider it as
                                a
                                part
                                of
                                the overall story.

            <h2>Provoke</h2>
            <p>
                A creature provokes when it leaves itself open to retaliation. This happens if an attack misses, or when a creature willingly moves out of another’s melee range. The target is granted a counterattack, the result of which depends on the original roll’s outcome. Advantage and Disadvantage rolls still apply, with double advantages or disadvantages becoming automatic success or failure. Critical results create memorable moments with significant effects as noted on character sheets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Provokes can also occur in ranged combat if the creature being targeted has a ranged option immediately available. A creature will likewise provoke if it moves out of another creature’s melee range without first using the Disengage half-action.
            </p>
            <h2>Damage and Non-D20 Rolls</h2>
            <p>
                Damage calculation usually starts with armor, then wounds inward unless otherwise specified. Non-d20 rolls are used for damage, spells, conditions, and random events, with the narrator providing dice for these specific situations.

                    <p>
                        In the game, checks dictate how your character interacts with the world and faces challenges. At
                        the
                        start, you're given 20 points to spread among these checks, but no check can receive more than
                        10 points
                        from this initial pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Math:</strong> When you roll a 20-sided die (d20), each outcome has a 5%
                        probability. The
                        average roll is 10.5, meaning there's a 50% likelihood of rolling 10 or above. Adding modifiers,
                        like a
                        +5 bonus, shifts the average roll to 15.5, enhancing your chances of superior results. As you
                        move up
                        the scale (15-34), outcomes improve, leading to better achievements in combat or surpassing
                        original
                        goals.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Minimum Wounds</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your wounds are equal to your Agility + Strength checks. If you put points into Agility or
                        Strength, it
                        increases your wounds by that much. If you do not have any points in either, you have a minimum
                        of 1. If
                        you put 1 into one of the checks, it would still be 1 until you raise it above the minimum.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Low Light Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                        In dark places where all you have is a torch or a flashlight, you use the low light vision stat.
                        Unless
                        otherwise stated, creatures cannot see in complete darkness. <br>

                        Emphasize to players the significance of full devotion in their training regimen. It's an
                        opportunity
                        for rich role-play, exploring the struggles and triumphs that define their character's growth.
                        While
                        occasional minor tasks are part of their routine, their narrative should be dominated by intense
                        and
                        purposeful training, shaping their journey towards greatness.

                    <p>
                        Loyalty not only measures individual trust and bonds but also reflects a character's reputation
                        within
                        factions or guilds, impacted by their actions and decisions. Positive deeds like completing
                        quests or
                        offering gifts enhance loyalty, while negative actions such as betrayal diminish it. This system
                        includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Individual Loyalty:</strong> Loyalty between characters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Group Reputation:</strong> A character's standing with factions or guilds changes
                            based on
                            their actions, affecting interactions and opportunities within those groups.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Loyalty points are earned or lost through these actions, dictating the character's relationship
                        and
                        standing within the community. Tiers range from Hostile to Unwavering to represent the depth of
                        trust or
                        disdain. Loyalty Checks, influenced by these points or the character's tier within the faction
                        or guild,
                        are pivotal in social encounters, leading to outcomes such as gaining access to unique
                        resources, facing
                        hostility, or unlocking special quests.

                    <h3>Character Health</h3>
                    <p>
                        Character health in this RPG pivots from traditional hit points to a system of armor and wounds
                        for a grittier
                        feel. <strong>Damage hits armor first</strong>, then wounds. Zero wounds result in being in the
                        Injured Condition
                        and further
                        damage risks the Death condition.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Armor</strong> acts as your first defense, absorbing damage until depleted, then
                            requires repairs.
                            Some spells boost
                            armor temporarily.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wounds</strong> track minor injuries, healed by rest or medical aid. Exhausting
                            wound capacity leads
                            to the Injured
                            condition; additional harm may cause death. Wound capacity is the sum of Agility and
                            Strength checks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Healing</strong> replenishes wounds up to the character's maximum, not affecting
                            armor or directly
                            curing conditions.
                        </li>

                    <h3>Combat and Non-Combat Mechanics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Finisher</strong>: A Finisher allows you to eliminate a helpless foe in one strike. Sleeping guards, bound prisoners, or creatures completely unaware of you can be ended instantly without playing through full combat. Stealth can help you set up a Finisher, but it is not required. This cannot be used on an active or aware opponent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Targeting</strong>: To attack, you must see, hear, or otherwise detect your target.
                            Lack of senses may impose disadvantages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cover</strong>: Targets behind half cover are at disadvantage to hit; targets behind
                            full cover cannot be targeted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stealth</strong>: Stealth lets you hide from enemies. Take an action to make a Stealth check. If successful, you are unseen and your next attack has Advantage, with additional consecutive attacks at Advantage for each success. Attacking, spellcasting, or revealing yourself in any other way ends Stealth unless a feature says otherwise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Surprise Turns</strong>: When attacking from stealth, you gain one extra action. This reveals your position unless an ability states otherwise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Called Shots</strong>: Aim for specific effects rather than damage. Declare before
                            attacking, accept a -10 to hit, and if successful, inflict conditions like Bleeding, Broken, or
                            Blind, instead of normal damage.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What You Can Do on Your Turn in Combat</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Move:</strong> Utilize your speed and terrain to reposition, dodge, or engage.
                            Movement can be split
                            before and after your action as needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Action:</strong> The primary activity you perform, like attacking or casting a
                            spell. Generally, you
                            get one action per turn, though certain abilities may offer more.</li>
                        <li><strong>Half-Actions:</strong> Smaller actions that can be doubled up in place of a full
                            action, such as
                            shooting and reloading a weapon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Off-Action:</strong> Can be used to attack on your turn or react off your turn
                            to a
                            missed attack.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Free-Action:</strong> Minor tasks or communication that don't consume your
                            action
                            economy, like quick
                            exchanges or item handling.</li>

                        Combat simplifies to a clash between your party and enemies, initiating with an attack and

                        Theater of the mind combat descriptions can focus on relative distances: melee, reach, short,
                        medium, long - rather than specifics, allowing for imaginative
                        engagement with
                        the scenario.

                        In combat, movement is a separate type of action from attacking or using items. During any turn
                        in combat, you
                        can move any amount of your movement speed at any point during your turn. For example, if you
                        have 30 ft of
                        movement, you can move 10 ft to approach a creature, attack, and then move 20 ft away. However,
                        if you engage a
                        creature in combat and then retreat, they may have an opportunity to attack you using their
                        Off-Action.

                            <strong>Fern-Tuft (ft) Definition:</strong> In this rulebook, "ft" does not stand for "feet"
                            but
                            for
                            "fern-tuft," a unit of measure slightly smaller than the traditional foot. This ensures that
                            when a character
                            moves 50ft in a turn, the distance is more practical within the game's context. For ease,
                            simply
                            use "ferns" to
                            refer to this unit of measurement in gameplay.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Difficult Terrain:</strong> Requires twice as much movement to navigate, so every 5
                            ft becomes
                            10ft.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jumping:</strong> Jump 5 ft from a standstill plus your Strength, or twice that
                            distance with a
                            running start.</li>
                        <li><strong>Climbing:</strong> Make a Strength check to move up to half your movement speed in
                            one turn. Failures
                            result in falling; make an Agility check to save yourself.</li>
                        <li><strong>Swimming:</strong> Swim at half your movement speed. Wearing heavy armor causes
                            sinking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prone:</strong> Being prone gives melee attackers advantage and ranged attackers
                            disadvantage.
                            Standing up costs 15 ft of movement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Moving Past Creatures:</strong> Move through a creature's space only if they are two
                            sizes smaller
                            (Tiny) or larger (Massive), or if they are allies who assist you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Falling:</strong> Take 5 bludgeoning damage per 10 ft of falling distance. Falls
                            that bring you to
                            the Injured Condition cause the Death Condition instead.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme Conditions:</strong> Hazardous environments, like lava or acid, cause 10
                            damage per round.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Burrowing:</strong> Creatures that burrow are immune to sight-based spells and
                            non-piercing weapons.
                            They need a way to breathe while burrowed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Teleport:</strong> Special creatures can teleport to another unoccupied space
                            without provoking</li>

                    <p>
                        Actions are activities that take only a few seconds to complete. They are distinct from
                        Half-Actions and
                        Off-Actions, which have different characteristics and limitations.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Attack:</strong> Make a melee or ranged attack against a creature or object within
                            range.</li>

                    <p>
                        Size in the world of adventuring isn't merely a matter of height and weight; it's a
                        key
                        factor in determining how a creature interacts with its environment and other
                        beings.
                        From the tiniest insect skittering unseen beneath a leaf to the towering giants
                        striding
                        across mountain ranges, size affects reach, stealth, strength, and vulnerability. A
                        creature's size can determine the spaces it can traverse, the opponents it can
                        challenge, and the impact of its presence in any given situation. In a realm of
                        magic
                        and might, understanding size is crucial for survival and success.

                    <p>
                        In the realm of Shek, gender is as varied as the landscapes that stretch from
                        soaring
                        peaks to deep mystical forests. Here, identity is not just male or female but also
                        includes the enigmatic dragon. Dragons, with their ancient magic, can fluidly shift
                        to
                        align with the souls of those they cherish. The changelings too, with their
                        transformative abilities, are not bound by any single form. In Shek, it's a gentle
                        reminder for all: never assume, for identity is a personal journey, unique as the
                        being
                        who walks its path.

            <h1>Bulk Items</h1>
            <p>
                Bulk represents the weight and space your gear occupies, from negligible trinkets to
                burdensome
                hauls. It's not just about weight but also the size and how cumbersome an item is. Managing
                your
                bulk is crucial for maintaining agility and avoiding encumbrance.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, a watch has 0 Bulk because it can be worn and forgotten about. Meanwhile, an
                empty
                barrel may be light but is awkward to carry, giving it a Bulk of 5.

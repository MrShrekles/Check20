                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <!-- Intro Fluff -->
                    <p>Welcome to Check20, a tabletop RPG set in the roaring 1920s, blending high fantasy with the era's
                        charm.
                        Our game focuses on worldbuilding, fast-paced combat, and deep in-world relationships. It values
                        player
                        creativity and group consensus over rigid rules. Survival is key, as characters face real
                        dangers,
                        and
                        not all battles are meant to be fought. Downtime is crucial, especially for roles like merchants
                        needing
                        time for their ventures. The game balances combat with social interactions, where NPCs offer
                        rich
                        stories and potential quests. It's a world where discovery, personal connections, and the thrill
                        of
                        combat coexist, against a backdrop of industrialization and magical mysteries. Players are
                        storytellers,
                        shaping the narrative with their actions in a world full of opportunities and challenges. Engage
                        with
                        the world, from running a jazz club to exploring treacherous lands, and let your imagination
                        guide
                        your
                        journey.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Narrator</h2>
                    <p>Your role is to create the game world, challenge players, and bring the story to life. Encourage
                        player
                        interaction and questions, and reward their achievements with points for character development.
                        Flexibility and adaptation to player actions are key for a dynamic and enjoyable game. Foster
                        creativity
                        and collaboration for a shared adventure.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Players are Characters</h2>
                    <p>Bring your character to life and collaborate with the group towards shared goals. Understand your
                        character's abilities and be proactive in story progression. Think creatively and communicate
                        effectively with the group for a rich, immersive experience.

                    <p>Engage in scenes set by the narrator, incorporating your character's background and goals.
                        Interact
                        with
                        the environment and other characters, guided by the narrator's descriptions. If rules are
                        uncertain,
                        the
                        narrator makes immediate, fair decisions, with adjustments made as needed. Focus on fun and
                        collaborative storytelling for a rewarding experience.

                    <h2>Types of Scenes</h2>
                    <p>There are several types of interactions that players may engage in during the game. These include
                        relationships, mysteries, problems, exploring, combat, and downtime.
                    </p>
                    <div class="features">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Relationships</strong> involve players interacting with characters from their
                                own
                                backstory
                                or with new characters introduced by the narrator. These interactions can lead to
                                intense
                                role-playing and can bring new connections to the group. Creatures and NPCs may have
                                basic
                                or
                                complex needs that players can exploit to gain something in return.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mysteries</strong> and problems are presented by the narrator for the players to
                                solve
                                or
                                interact with. These can range from missing children, bounties, or haunted houses that
                                need
                                to
                                be
                                dealt with. Exploring the world created by the narrator allows players to discover new
                                areas
                                and
                                locations, and can lead to building relationships with local businesses or guilds.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Combat</strong> in this system is brutal, and players should be prepared for
                                tough
                                engagements. It is important to consider conditions and locking out creatures and NPCs
                                from
                                being
                                able to act, rather than relying on hit points. Downtime involves characters recovering
                                from
                                battle
                                and taking care of their equipment, which can lead to further interactions and
                                connections
                                within
                                the city. Finally, character death is something to be expected in combat, but it does
                                not
                                necessarily mean the end of play. The group may consider seeking revival through a
                                temple
                                priest
                                or
                                hospital doctor.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Character Death</strong> is a potential outcome of combat, and players should be
                                prepared
                                for it. However, death is not necessarily the end of play. The group may consider
                                seeking
                                revival
                                through a temple priest or hospital doctor, or may choose to continue the game with a
                                new
                                character.
                                It is important to remember that character death should be taken seriously and not
                                approached
                                with a
                                mindset of always winning
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Downtime</strong> is an important aspect of the game, as it allows characters to
                                recover
                                from battle and tend to their equipment. Repairing armor and interacting with
                                blacksmiths to
                                afford
                                it can lead to further connections within the city and can involve other types of
                                interactions,
                                such
                                as favors or quests. It is important to not take downtime lightly and to consider it as
                                a
                                part
                                of
                                the overall story.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the game, dice, particularly the d20, are used to resolve actions and outcomes. A roll of 15
                        or
                        higher typically signifies success. Actions are categorized by duration, from immediate actions
                        to
                        whole-day tasks. When rolling, players add relevant stats known as Checks to determine outcomes,
                        which
                        range from failure to multiple successes (Success to Success +++) based on the roll. Higher
                        successes
                        may unlock greater effects or damage in combat. Failures present challenges but are not the end,
                        offering narrative depth and problem-solving opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Opportunity Attacks</h3>
                    <p>
                        Opportunity Attacks occur when an attack misses or when a creature willingly moves out of your
                        melee
                        range, allowing the target a counterattack, which varies based on the initial roll's outcome.
                        Advantage
                        and Disadvantage rolls adjust difficulty, with double advantages or disadvantages resulting in
                        automatic
                        success or failure. Critical successes or failures bring memorable moments, potentially with
                        significant
                        effects as outlined on character sheets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Opportunity attacks can also occur in ranged combat if the creature being attacked has a ranged
                        option
                        immediately available. Opportunity attacks will also trigger if a creature is within another
                        creature's
                        melee attack range and willingly leaves that range without taking the Disengage half-action.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Damage and Non-D20 Rolls</h2>
                    <p>
                        Damage calculation starts with armor, then wounds inward unless otherwise specified. Non-d20
                        rolls
                        are
                        used for damage, spells, conditions, and random events, with the narrator providing dice for
                        these
                        specific situations.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Critical Hits and Failures</h2>
                    <p>
                        Critical hits can deal double damage, trigger additional effects, or even instantly defeat foes
                        under
                        specific conditions. Critical failures may result in reduced damage, equipment malfunctions, or
                        other
                        complications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Criticals in Combat:</strong> Critical hits deal double damage, roll an additional time
                        on
                        the
                        damage tables, roll on a random damage table, or instantly kill the creature if they are near
                        death
                        or
                        if the situation warrants it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Critical Failure:</strong> On a critical failure but still a hit, it should deal half
                        damage, or
                        the weapon could break, fall out of their hands, or create another complication on the
                        battlefield.
                        Perhaps the spell deals damage back or fails. A critical failure should not equal a success, but
                        a
                        creature with a +15 in a check should never really fail.
                    </p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>
                        In the game, checks dictate how your character interacts with the world and faces challenges. At
                        the
                        start, you're given 20 points to spread among these checks, but no check can receive more than
                        10 points
                        from this initial pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Math:</strong> When you roll a 20-sided die (d20), each outcome has a 5%
                        probability. The
                        average roll is 10.5, meaning there's a 50% likelihood of rolling 10 or above. Adding modifiers,
                        like a
                        +5 bonus, shifts the average roll to 15.5, enhancing your chances of superior results. As you
                        move up
                        the scale (15-34), outcomes improve, leading to better achievements in combat or surpassing
                        original
                        goals.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Minimum Wounds</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your wounds are equal to your Agility + Strength checks. If you put points into Agility or
                        Strength, it
                        increases your wounds by that much. If you do not have any points in either, you have a minimum
                        of 1. If
                        you put 1 into one of the checks, it would still be 1 until you raise it above the minimum.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Low Light Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                        In dark places where all you have is a torch or a flashlight, you use the low light vision stat.
                        Unless
                        otherwise stated, creatures cannot see in complete darkness. <br>

                    <p>
                        Characters can train to boost their abilities. While the Merchant is off doing business deals,
                        the Tank
                        is in the gym training or perhaps in the library rounding out their skills.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Training Duration</h3>

                        <li><strong>Months needed = desired ability value.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> To go from Strength 3 to 4, train for 4 months. To go from 1 to 4 would
                        be 9
                        months:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1-2: 2 months</li>
                        <li>2-3: 3 months</li>

                    <h3>Training Commitment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Emphasize to players the significance of full devotion in their training regimen. It's an
                        opportunity
                        for rich role-play, exploring the struggles and triumphs that define their character's growth.
                        While
                        occasional minor tasks are part of their routine, their narrative should be dominated by intense
                        and
                        purposeful training, shaping their journey towards greatness.

                        standing within the community. Tiers range from Hostile to Unwavering to represent the depth of
                        trust or
                        disdain. Loyalty Checks, influenced by these points or the character's tier within the faction
                        or guild,
                        are pivotal in social encounters, leading to outcomes such as gaining access to unique
                        resources, facing
                        hostility, or unlocking special quests.

                    <h3>Character Health</h3>
                    <p>
                        Character health in this RPG pivots from traditional hit points to a system of armor and wounds
                        for a grittier
                        feel. <strong>Damage hits armor first</strong>, then wounds. Zero wounds result in being in the
                        Injured Condition
                        and further
                        damage risks the Death condition.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Armor</strong> acts as your first defense, absorbing damage until depleted, then
                            requires repairs.
                            Some spells boost
                            armor temporarily.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wounds</strong> track minor injuries, healed by rest or medical aid. Exhausting
                            wound capacity leads
                            to the Injured
                            condition; additional harm may cause death. Wound capacity is the sum of Agility and
                            Strength checks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Healing</strong> replenishes wounds up to the character's maximum, not affecting
                            armor or directly
                            curing conditions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Combat and Non-Combat Mechanics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Finisher</strong>: This rule lets characters end a fight quickly if they attack
                            unseen, if their foe can't fight back,
                            or is caught off guard. A successful stealth check can confirm a silent, instant defeat,
                            regardless of the
                            enemy's remaining health. This option is ideal when facing a lone, defenseless target or an
                            unsuspecting one
                            in a vulnerable state, such as sleeping without guards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Targeting</strong>: To attack, you must see, hear, or otherwise detect your target.
                            Lack of senses may impose
                            disadvantages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cover</strong>: Targets behind half cover are at disadvantage to hit; targets behind
                            full cover cannot be targeted.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Surprise Turns</strong>: Attacking from stealth can grant an extra turn. Reveals the
                            attacker's position unless
                            abilities say otherwise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Called Shots</strong>: Aim for specific effects rather than damage. Declare before
                            attacking, accept a -10 to hit, and
                            if successful, inflict conditions like Bleeding, Broken, or Blind, instead of normal damage.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What You Can Do on Your Turn in Combat</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Move:</strong> Utilize your speed and terrain to reposition, dodge, or engage.
                            Movement can be split
                            before and after your action as needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Action:</strong> The primary activity you perform, like attacking or casting a
                            spell. Generally, you
                            get one action per turn, though certain abilities may offer more.</li>
                        <li><strong>Half-Actions:</strong> Smaller actions that can be doubled up in place of a full
                            action, such as
                            shooting and reloading a weapon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Off-Action:</strong> Can be used to attack on your turn or react off your turn
                            to a
                            missed attack.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Free-Action:</strong> Minor tasks or communication that don't consume your
                            action
                            economy, like quick
                            exchanges or item handling.</li>

                        Combat simplifies to a clash between your party and enemies, initiating with an attack and
                        proceeding in
                        turn-based rounds, where strategy aims to incapacitate opponents akin to chess's checkmate,

                        In combat, movement is a separate type of action from attacking or using items. During any turn
                        in combat, you
                        can move any amount of your movement speed at any point during your turn. For example, if you
                        have 30 ft of
                        movement, you can move 10 ft to approach a creature, attack, and then move 20 ft away. However,
                        if you engage a
                        creature in combat and then retreat, they may have an opportunity to attack you using their
                        Off-Action.

                            <strong>Fern-Tuft (ft) Definition:</strong> In this rulebook, "ft" does not stand for "feet"
                            but
                            for
                            "fern-tuft," a unit of measure slightly smaller than the traditional foot. This ensures that
                            when a character
                            moves 50ft in a turn, the distance is more practical within the game's context. For ease,
                            simply
                            use "ferns" to
                            refer to this unit of measurement in gameplay.

                    <h4>Types of Movement</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Difficult Terrain:</strong> Requires twice as much movement to navigate, so every 5
                            ft becomes
                            10ft.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jumping:</strong> Jump 5 ft from a standstill plus your Strength, or twice that
                            distance with a
                            running start.</li>
                        <li><strong>Climbing:</strong> Make a Strength check to move up to half your movement speed in
                            one turn. Failures
                            result in falling; make an Agility check to save yourself.</li>
                        <li><strong>Swimming:</strong> Swim at half your movement speed. Wearing heavy armor causes
                            sinking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prone:</strong> Being prone gives melee attackers advantage and ranged attackers
                            disadvantage.
                            Standing up costs 15 ft of movement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Moving Past Creatures:</strong> Move through a creature's space only if they are two
                            sizes smaller
                            (Tiny) or larger (Massive), or if they are allies who assist you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Falling:</strong> Take 5 bludgeoning damage per 10 ft of falling distance. Falls
                            that bring you to
                            the Injured Condition cause the Death Condition instead.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme Conditions:</strong> Hazardous environments, like lava or acid, cause 10
                            damage per round.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Burrowing:</strong> Creatures that burrow are immune to sight-based spells and
                            non-piercing weapons.
                            They need a way to breathe while burrowed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Teleport:</strong> Special creatures can teleport to another unoccupied space
                            without provoking
                            opportunity attacks.</li>

                    <p>
                        Actions are activities that take only a few seconds to complete. They are distinct from
                        Half-Actions and
                        Off-Actions, which have different characteristics and limitations.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Attack:</strong> Make a melee or ranged attack against a creature or object within
                            range.</li>

                    <h1>Armor</h1>

                    <p>
                        When adventuring, armor is your primary line of defense. It's essential to ally with a
                        blacksmith who can repair and upgrade your gear. In combat, armor absorbs hits before they
                        affect your health. Remember, armor is not destroyed when its protection points are
                        depleted; it
                        simply can't offer protection until repaired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Armor also shields against poison, as venom requires direct contact with the skin to be
                        effective. Be cautious, as wearing too much heavy gear can impose the 'pinned' condition,
                        hindering your movement.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Armor Penalties: </strong> If a check's modifier is negative, it is considered a penalty.
                        Features that negate penalties can remove these effects.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Magic Penalty:</strong> This is in reference to your spellcasting check, whatever it
                        might be for
                        your Class, Path, Talent, and so on</p>

                                to repair [[1d6]] + Crafting points of armor integrity. This represents quick fixes
                                using whatever materials are at hand.

                                This involves physical repairs like patching holes or replacing segments.

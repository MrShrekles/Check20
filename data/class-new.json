The entity grants strength, resilience, and instinctive violence, but every benefit comes at the cost of endurance, autonomy, and time.\nSkellbund walk a narrow line between mastery and collapse. The bound presence reacts faster than thought, resists death with brutal insistence, and occasionally asserts itself without permission. Demons recognize the arrangement immediately.

Where a Virtuoso stands, rhythm asserts itself.\nIn taverns and halls, Virtuosos are effortless, magnetic, and familiar, slipping between crowds as easily as they do between strikes. On the battlefield, that same grace becomes authority. Allies find their footing steadier, their timing truer. Enemies, whether they realize it or not, begin to move off-beat, stumbling into openings they did not know they created. Faint echoes of celestial light ripple across a Virtuoso’s form when they dance or fight in Dumda’s name, a reminder that music is not entertainment, but the oldest law binding the world together.",

They weaponize procedure itself, serving documents that suspend action, enforcing protocols that stretch seconds into minutes, and creating delays so absolute they feel like stopped time. Their influence is not loud or visible, but inevitable. Wars pause for signatures. Monsters hesitate when named in triplicate.

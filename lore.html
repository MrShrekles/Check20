                    <p><strong>Hook:</strong> After a long rest, all players make a Luck check. The lowest roll wakes up with their eyes missing—no blood, no pain.</p>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A squat, purple-furred creature with dozens of yellow-ringed eyes twitching over a swollen scalp. It murmurs in a nasal lisp and scuttles with soft, padded limbs. Eyes blink independently, watching everything—especially the ones it hasn't stolen yet.</p>

                    <h2>🔥 Demon Orders of Ordealis</h2>
                </div>
        
                <div class="card-content">        
                    <p><strong>Hook:</strong> Whenever a demon is wounded, destroyed, or left to rot in Ordealis, something new may grow from what remains. Use these categories to quickly decide what crawls out of the wreckage.</p>
        
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Demons in Ordealis are not a single species. They are ecosystems of torment, instinct, and warped identity. Limbs grow into predators, shadows rewrite minds, and crystal screams weld themselves into jagged bodies. The categories below describe common strains of demonic life that infest the plane.</p>
        
                    <h3>🩸 Demon Categories</h3>
                    <ul class="card-points">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Lesser Demons:</strong>
                            Scraps of greater entities, discarded limbs, torn flesh, severed will, or emotional fragments that refuse to die. Anything ripped from a demon in Ordealis can crawl away and begin to grow, feeding on soulstuff and consuming weaker demons. As they gorge, they twist into unpredictable forms and often merge with whatever they have devoured. Lesser Demons are the wildlife of Ordealis, constantly shifting and mutating.
                        </li>
        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Knights:</strong>
                            Demons who have survived long enough, or killed enough rivals, to anchor themselves into a stable form. Their bodies harden into armor plating, weapons erupt from bone, and their instincts narrow into a strict sense of territory. Many Knights shed pieces of themselves, which later grow into armored Lesser Demons that serve their domain. They act as enforcers and territorial captains throughout Ordealis.
                        </li>
        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Clogwork Constructs:</strong>
                            Grown rather than forged, mostly in the Clockwork Labyrinth. They are made from helflesh shaped under ritual pressure and demonic engineering. They mimic gears, pistons, and mechanisms, but their components are alive, using tendon belts, bone cogs, and cartilage springs. Some hold trapped souls that act as processors. Clogwork creatures serve as maintainers, guardians, or living infrastructure.
                        </li>
        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Helmaw Demons:</strong>
                            Bestial creatures driven by instinct more than ideology. They resemble warped versions of animals with demonic features and ritualized pack hierarchies. Many Greater Demons originate from the Helmaw through cycles of dominance and violence. They form the animal kingdom of Ordealis, acting as territorial predators and organized packs.
                        </li>
        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Greater Demons:</strong>
                            Unique demons of enormous size and influence. They have consumed enough souls or endured enough torment to twist into vast, imposing forms. Their bodies often warp into symbolic shapes tied to their domain, becoming living landmarks or mobile catastrophes. Most live in the Fields of Torment beyond the Temple of Asmo and rule over lesser demons like tyrant kings.
                        </li>
        
                        <li>
                            <strong>The Unshapen:</strong>
                            Children of Azazel whose forms never settle. They drift like shadows of identity, slipping into bodies, overwriting minds, or whispering doubts that unravel personality. They often appear as silhouettes, reflections that move on their own, or distortions of familiar shapes. The Unshapen feed on memory and will rather than flesh.
                        </li>
        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Hellmuk Demons:</strong>
                            Beings of ooze, rot, fungus, and dissolution. Born from pits of decay or the influence of the Oozemother, they shift between liquid, spore, and sludge states. Their forms corrode matter and identity, and they can absorb or engulf other demons to grow new mutations. Fungal demons and rot-beasts fall under the Hellmuk umbrella, making them extremely adaptive.
                        </li>
        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Hellites:</strong>
                            Crystal demons formed where torment has compressed into solid shards. Their bodies fracture light into warped colors, their voices ring like broken glass, and their forms crack and reassemble as they move. They resemble jagged shards, prismatic fiends, or mirror-backed horrors. Each fracture in their crystal bodies may contain a preserved scream or stolen emotion.
                        </li>
        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Drakspawn:</strong>
                            Demonic dragons created from the warped essence or remains of Tiamat. They are not divine, but corrupted forms shaped by demonic pressure. Their bodies resemble dragons in silhouette but contain too many teeth, molten bone, smoke filled organs, or multiple heads that argue with themselves. Some begin as small wyrmlings that rapidly metastasize into towering abominations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h3>⚔️ Using These In Play</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>After a boss fight:</strong> Roll or choose a category to see what grows out of discarded demon parts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Travel scenes:</strong> Treat Lesser Demons, Helmaw packs, or Hellmuk swarms as the “wildlife” of Ordealis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Territory and politics:</strong> Knights and Greater Demons shape regions. Choose one as the local tyrant.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mental horror:</strong> Use the Unshapen and Hellites when you want memory, identity, or emotion to be under attack.</li>
                        <li><strong>Boss escalations:</strong> A slain Greater Demon might leave behind a Drakspawn egg, a Clogwork heart, or a Hellmuk pit.</li>
                    </ol>

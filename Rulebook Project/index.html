                    <p>Welcome to Check20, a tabletop RPG set in the roaring 1920s, blending high fantasy with the era's
                        charm.
                        Our game focuses on worldbuilding, fast-paced combat, and deep in-world relationships. It values
                        player
                        creativity and group consensus over rigid rules. Survival is key, as characters face real
                        dangers,
                        and
                        not all battles are meant to be fought. Downtime is crucial, especially for roles like merchants
                        needing
                        time for their ventures. The game balances combat with social interactions, where NPCs offer
                        rich
                        stories and potential quests. It's a world where discovery, personal connections, and the thrill
                        of
                        combat coexist, against a backdrop of industrialization and magical mysteries. Players are
                        storytellers,
                        shaping the narrative with their actions in a world full of opportunities and challenges. Engage
                        with
                        the world, from running a jazz club to exploring treacherous lands, and let your imagination
                        guide
                        your
                        journey.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Narrator</h2>
                    <p>Your role is to create the game world, challenge players, and bring the story to life. Encourage
                        player
                        interaction and questions, and reward their achievements with points for character development.
                        Flexibility and adaptation to player actions are key for a dynamic and enjoyable game. Foster
                        creativity
                        and collaboration for a shared adventure.

                    <h2>Players are Characters</h2>
                    <p>Bring your character to life and collaborate with the group towards shared goals. Understand your

                        with
                        the environment and other characters, guided by the narrator's descriptions. If rules are
                        uncertain,
                        the
                        narrator makes immediate, fair decisions, with adjustments made as needed. Focus on fun and

                    <h2>Types of Scenes</h2>
                    <p>There are several types of interactions that players may engage in during the game. These include
                        relationships, mysteries, problems, exploring, combat, and downtime.

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Relationships</strong> involve players interacting with characters from their
                                own
                                backstory
                                or with new characters introduced by the narrator. These interactions can lead to
                                intense
                                role-playing and can bring new connections to the group. Creatures and NPCs may have
                                basic
                                or
                                complex needs that players can exploit to gain something in return.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mysteries</strong> and problems are presented by the narrator for the players to
                                solve
                                or
                                interact with. These can range from missing children, bounties, or haunted houses that
                                need
                                to
                                be
                                dealt with. Exploring the world created by the narrator allows players to discover new
                                areas
                                and
                                locations, and can lead to building relationships with local businesses or guilds.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Combat</strong> in this system is brutal, and players should be prepared for
                                tough
                                engagements. It is important to consider conditions and locking out creatures and NPCs
                                from
                                being
                                able to act, rather than relying on hit points. Downtime involves characters recovering
                                from
                                battle
                                and taking care of their equipment, which can lead to further interactions and
                                connections
                                within
                                the city. Finally, character death is something to be expected in combat, but it does
                                not
                                necessarily mean the end of play. The group may consider seeking revival through a
                                temple
                                priest
                                or
                                hospital doctor.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Character Death</strong> is a potential outcome of combat, and players should be
                                prepared
                                for it. However, death is not necessarily the end of play. The group may consider
                                seeking
                                revival
                                through a temple priest or hospital doctor, or may choose to continue the game with a
                                new
                                character.
                                It is important to remember that character death should be taken seriously and not
                                approached
                                with a
                                mindset of always winning
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Downtime</strong> is an important aspect of the game, as it allows characters to
                                recover
                                from battle and tend to their equipment. Repairing armor and interacting with
                                blacksmiths to
                                afford
                                it can lead to further connections within the city and can involve other types of
                                interactions,
                                such
                                as favors or quests. It is important to not take downtime lightly and to consider it as
                                a
                                part
                                of
                                the overall story.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the game, dice, particularly the d20, are used to resolve actions and outcomes. A roll of 15
                        or
                        higher typically signifies success. Actions are categorized by duration, from immediate actions
                        to
                        whole-day tasks. When rolling, players add relevant stats known as Checks to determine outcomes,
                        which
                        range from failure to multiple successes (Success to Success +++) based on the roll. Higher
                        successes
                        may unlock greater effects or damage in combat. Failures present challenges but are not the end,
                        offering narrative depth and problem-solving opportunities.

                    <p>
                        Opportunity Attacks occur when an attack misses or when a creature willingly moves out of your
                        melee
                        range, allowing the target a counterattack, which varies based on the initial roll's outcome.
                        Advantage
                        and Disadvantage rolls adjust difficulty, with double advantages or disadvantages resulting in
                        automatic
                        success or failure. Critical successes or failures bring memorable moments, potentially with
                        significant
                        effects as outlined on character sheets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Opportunity attacks can also occur in ranged combat if the creature being attacked has a ranged
                        option
                        immediately available. Opportunity attacks will also trigger if a creature is within another
                        creature's
                        melee attack range and willingly leaves that range without taking the Disengage half-action.

                    <h2>Critical Hits and Failures</h2>
                    <p>
                        Critical hits can deal double damage, trigger additional effects, or even instantly defeat foes
                        under
                        specific conditions. Critical failures may result in reduced damage, equipment malfunctions, or
                        other
                        complications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Criticals in Combat:</strong> Critical hits deal double damage, roll an additional time
                        on
                        the
                        damage tables, roll on a random damage table, or instantly kill the creature if they are near
                        death
                        or
                        if the situation warrants it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Critical Failure:</strong> On a critical failure but still a hit, it should deal half
                        damage, or
                        the weapon could break, fall out of their hands, or create another complication on the
                        battlefield.
                        Perhaps the spell deals damage back or fails. A critical failure should not equal a success, but
                        a
                        creature with a +15 in a check should never really fail.

                        A niche roll is the opposed check, where two characters make rolls, adding their designated
                        check
                        against another creature or player making the same roll and adding their values as well. The
                        winner
                        of
                        the check is the creature with the higher roll value.

                        In the game, checks dictate how your character interacts with the world and faces challenges. At
                        the
                        start, you're given 20 points to spread among these checks, but no check can receive more than
                        10 points
                        from this initial pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Math:</strong> When you roll a 20-sided die (d20), each outcome has a 5%
                        probability. The
                        average roll is 10.5, meaning there's a 50% likelihood of rolling 10 or above. Adding modifiers,
                        like a
                        +5 bonus, shifts the average roll to 15.5, enhancing your chances of superior results. As you
                        move up
                        the scale (15-34), outcomes improve, leading to better achievements in combat or surpassing
                        original
                        goals.

                    <h3>Minimum Wounds</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your wounds are equal to your Agility + Strength checks. If you put points into Agility or
                        Strength, it
                        increases your wounds by that much. If you do not have any points in either, you have a minimum
                        of 1. If
                        you put 1 into one of the checks, it would still be 1 until you raise it above the minimum.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Low Light Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                        In dark places where all you have is a torch or a flashlight, you use the low light vision stat.
                        Unless
                        otherwise stated, creatures cannot see in complete darkness. <br>

                        the Tank
                        is in the gym training or perhaps in the library rounding out their skills.

                        be 9
                        months:

                    <p>
                        Emphasize to players the significance of full devotion in their training regimen. It's an
                        opportunity
                        for rich role-play, exploring the struggles and triumphs that define their character's growth.
                        While
                        occasional minor tasks are part of their routine, their narrative should be dominated by intense
                        and
                        purposeful training, shaping their journey towards greatness.

                    <p>
                        Loyalty not only measures individual trust and bonds but also reflects a character's reputation
                        within
                        factions or guilds, impacted by their actions and decisions. Positive deeds like completing
                        quests or
                        offering gifts enhance loyalty, while negative actions such as betrayal diminish it. This system
                        includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Individual Loyalty:</strong> Loyalty between characters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Group Reputation:</strong> A character's standing with factions or guilds changes
                            based on
                            their actions, affecting interactions and opportunities within those groups.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Loyalty points are earned or lost through these actions, dictating the character's relationship
                        and
                        standing within the community. Tiers range from Hostile to Unwavering to represent the depth of
                        trust or
                        disdain. Loyalty Checks, influenced by these points or the character's tier within the faction
                        or guild,
                        are pivotal in social encounters, leading to outcomes such as gaining access to unique

                        Combat simplifies to a clash between your party and enemies, initiating with an attack and
                        proceeding in
                        turn-based rounds, where strategy aims to incapacitate opponents akin to chess's checkmate,
                        either
                        through
                        strategic disadvantage or elimination. Consideration for peaceful resolutions or stealth
                        approaches
                        can enrich
                        the roleplaying experience.

                        Morale checks for enemies can dictate their willingness to fight, with
                        living beings
                        more likely to flee than undead.
                        Turn order is determined by an initiative roll, which is a roll +
                        Agility check, proceeding until one side wins or retreats. Actions can be delayed for strategic
                        timing within one's
                        turn, maintaining the chosen initiative position.

                    <h3>Character Health</h3>
                    <p>
                        Character health in this RPG pivots from traditional hit points to a system of armor and wounds
                        for a grittier
                        feel. Damage hits armor first, then wounds. Zero wounds result in being in the Injured Condition
                        and further
                        damage risks the Death condition.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Armor acts as your first defense, absorbing damage until depleted, then requires repairs.
                            Some spells boost
                            armor temporarily.</li>
                        <li>Wounds track minor injuries, healed by rest or medical aid. Exhausting wound capacity leads
                            to the Injured
                            condition; additional harm may cause death. Wound capacity is the sum of Agility and
                            Strength checks.</li>
                        <li>Healing replenishes wounds up to the character's maximum, not affecting armor or directly
                            curing conditions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Press On</h3>
                    <p>
                        After a combat encounter, characters can "Press On" to regain 1 class resource, 1 spell point,
                        repair armor for
                        <code>[[1d6]]</code> + Crafting, heal for <code>[[1d6]]</code> + Survival, and remove all
                        conditions and effects lasting
                        for 1 minute or
                        less. This option can be used twice per day, but not consecutively without engaging in another
                        combat.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Long Rest</h3>
                    <p>
                        A long rest requires 10 hours of uninterrupted downtime, fully restoring all wounds, recharging
                        class resources,
                        repairing all armor to at least half, and removing any conditions that last one day or less.
                        Characters can only
                        take a long rest once per long rest and must be in a safe environment.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Move:</strong> Utilize your speed and terrain to reposition, dodge, or engage.
                            Movement can be split
                            before and after your action as needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Action:</strong> The primary activity you perform, like attacking or casting a
                            spell. Generally, you
                            get one action per turn, though certain abilities may offer more.</li>
                        <li><strong>Half-Actions:</strong> Smaller actions that can be doubled up in place of a full
                            action, such as
                            shooting and reloading a weapon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Off-Action:</strong> Can be used to attack on your turn or react off your turn to a
                            missed attack.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Free-Action:</strong> Minor tasks or communication that don't consume your action
                            economy, like quick
                            exchanges or item handling.</li>

                    <h3>Combat and Non-Combat Mechanics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Finisher</strong>: This rule lets characters end a fight quickly if they attack
                            unseen, if their foe can't fight back,
                            or is caught off guard. A successful stealth check can confirm a silent, instant defeat,
                            regardless of the
                            enemy's remaining health. This option is ideal when facing a lone, defenseless target or an
                            unsuspecting one
                            in a vulnerable state, such as sleeping without guards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Targeting</strong>: To attack, you must see, hear, or otherwise detect your target.
                            Lack of senses may impose
                            disadvantages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cover</strong>: Targets behind half cover are at disadvantage to hit; targets behind
                            full cover cannot be targeted.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Surprise Turns</strong>: Attacking from stealth can grant an extra turn. Reveals the
                            attacker's position unless
                            abilities say otherwise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Called Shots</strong>: Aim for specific effects rather than damage. Declare before
                            attacking, accept a -10 to hit, and
                            if successful, inflict conditions like Bleeding, Broken, or Blind, instead of normal damage.
                        </li>

                    <h2>Movement</h2>
                    <p>
                        In combat, movement is a separate type of action from attacking or using items. During any turn
                        in combat, you
                        can move any amount of your movement speed at any point during your turn. For example, if you
                        have 30 ft of
                        movement, you can move 10 ft to approach a creature, attack, and then move 20 ft away. However,
                        if you engage a
                        creature in combat and then retreat, they may have an opportunity to attack you using their
                        Off-Action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Fern-Tuft (ft) Definition:</strong> In this rulebook, "ft" does not stand for "feet" but
                        for
                        "fern-tuft," a unit of measure slightly smaller than the traditional foot. This ensures that
                        when a character
                        moves 50ft in a turn, the distance is more practical within the game's context. For ease, simply
                        use "ferns" to
                        refer to this unit of measurement in gameplay.

                <section>
                    <h3>Types of Movement</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Difficult Terrain:</strong> Requires twice as much movement to navigate, so every 5
                            ft becomes
                            10ft.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jumping:</strong> Jump 5 ft from a standstill plus your Strength, or twice that
                            distance with a
                            running start.</li>
                        <li><strong>Climbing:</strong> Make a Strength check to move up to half your movement speed in
                            one turn. Failures
                            result in falling; make an Agility check to save yourself.</li>
                        <li><strong>Swimming:</strong> Swim at half your movement speed. Wearing heavy armor causes
                            sinking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prone:</strong> Being prone gives melee attackers advantage and ranged attackers
                            disadvantage.
                            Standing up costs 15 ft of movement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Moving Past Creatures:</strong> Move through a creature's space only if they are two
                            sizes smaller
                            (Tiny) or larger (Massive), or if they are allies who assist you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Falling:</strong> Take 5 bludgeoning damage per 10 ft of falling distance. Falls
                            that bring you to
                            the Injured Condition cause the Death Condition instead.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme Conditions:</strong> Hazardous environments, like lava or acid, cause 10
                            damage per round.
                        </li>

                    Damage & Damage Types
                </summary>
                <p>In the world of Shek, numerous damage types exist, each with unique properties and effects. When a
                    character rolls a success+ or greater with a weapon or spell, they have the opportunity to roll on
                    the associated damage table, leading to a variety of outcomes. Here's an overview of the damage
                    types and their potential interactions with armor, wounds, and injuries:
                    These are organized by physical, elemental, and Realm Damage types. These are in each category not
                    because of the amount of damage they do but what conditions and effects they cause on their damage
                    tables. physical damage will often just deal additional damage while Realm Damage can cause
                    immediate injuries or banish creatures to alternate planes momentarily.
                    If an ability, weapon, gear, spell or whatever says it deals physical damage, it means a physical
                    damage type of your choice. Same thing if it says elemental or realm. If you are given a choice at
                    the time of creation of an item that usually means that item is locked into that damage type, unless
                    you and the narrator determine that it is a shifting item or if it says so in the description.
                    A weapon can only have one type of damage. If you have abilities that add damage to a weapon, spell
                    or ability then it adds that on and doesn't change the type unless otherwise specified. A glyph can
                    change the type of damage on a weapon. When you make a check with multiple successes then the
                    weapon’s damage type is used, not the additional damage types.

                                blows. This type of damage shatters defenses and can leave foes dazed and reeling,
                                representing the sheer power behind a solid, heavy strike.</p>

                            <p>Sharp and precise, piercing damage comes from weapons like arrows, spears, and daggers,
                                which are designed to penetrate armor and flesh alike. Each thrust or shot aims for
                                vital points, making it deadly in the hands of a skilled wielder.</p>

                                damage represents the destructive power of alchemical concoctions, venomous creatures,

                                light. It encompasses the creeping death of necromancy, the suffocating embrace of
                                smoke, and the chill of pure darkness.</p>

                                movement. Ice damage can encase enemies in frost, rendering them brittle and vulnerable
                                to shattering.</p>

                                animals, and the elements. It can manifest as thorny vines, swarming insects, or the
                                relentless force of wind and rain, often bringing disease and decay to those who fall

                                leaves a lingering taint on the soul.</p>

                        <p>The Power Level (PL) system provides a simple and effective way to create and manage
                            monsters,
                            enemies, and NPCs. This system allows narrators to quickly generate creatures with
                            appropriate
                            stats for any encounter, ensuring balance and flexibility.</p>

                                <p>A standard lock that requires a traditional <em>Physical Key</em>. It can range from
                                    basic padlocks to more complex tumbler mechanisms. These locks are susceptible to
                                    lockpicking or brute force.</p>

                                <p>A <em>Blood Lock</em> requires the touch of blood to open. Depending on the
                                    difficulty,
                                    it might require the blood of a specific creature, a creature type, or just any

                                    blood. A <em>Blood Key</em> often takes the form of a dagger-like object that
                                    requires a
                                    cut to activate, channeling the essence of the wielder into the lock.</p>

                                <p>A <em>Soul Lock</em> remains closed until touched by a specific soul linked to it. In
                                    more challenging versions, a soul must be sacrificed for the lock to open. The

                        <h3>Trap Power Levels (PL)</h3>
                        <p>Trap PL is a modular system that allows narrators to scale traps for their desired level of
                            danger or challenge. Each PL adds to the damage, range, or complexity of a trap. Use the
                            following guidelines to adapt traps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Traps deal <code>1d6</code> damage per PL (e.g., a PL 2 trap
                                deals
                                <code>2d6</code> damage).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Range:</strong> Trap effects scale by area or target range. A PL 1 trap has a
                                range
                                of 5 ft, increasing by +5 ft per PL. For example, a PL 10 trap would affect a 50 ft
                                radius.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>+Table:</strong> Every 3 PL adds a roll on the +Table for the damage type of the
                                trap. For example, a PL 3 trap would act similarly to a Success+ on a weapon attack,
                                adding
                                effects like conditions or bonus damage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disarm:</strong> Traps can typically be disarmed with either a Physical check
                                (e.g.,
                                Agility or Strength) or a Mental check (e.g., Intellect or Spirit), depending on the
                                trap
                                type.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Generic Trap Types</h4>
                        <p>Below are common trap concepts for narrators to customize. Apply damage types, conditions, or
                            thematic elements as needed.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Dart Trap: </strong>A hidden mechanism fires a projectile when triggered. Damage
                                type can be chosen by the narrator (e.g., Toxic, Piercing, Fire).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Rune Trap:</strong>
                                Magical symbols activate when disturbed, unleashing effects like explosions, curses, or
                                elemental damage. Narrators can define the damage type (e.g., Fire, Lightning, or
                                Psychic).
                            </li>

                                <strong>Trap Door:</strong>
                                A concealed mechanism drops the target into a pit or hazard. Damage type depends on the
                                environment (e.g., Impact, Spikes, or Lava).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Gas Trap:</strong>
                                Releases a harmful cloud when triggered. Narrators can specify conditions (e.g.,
                                Coughing,
                                Poisoned) and damage type (e.g., Toxic or Eclipse).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Net Trap:</strong>
                                Launches a net to immobilize targets, applying the <em>Pinned</em> condition. Narrators
                                can
                                add enhancements like barbs (Piercing damage) or elemental effects.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Illusion Trap:</strong>
                                Creates a deceptive or disorienting visual or auditory effect. Can impose conditions
                                like
                                <em>Blind</em>, <em>Confused</em>, or <em>Frightened</em>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Explosive Trap:</strong>
                                Triggers an area-of-effect blast. Damage type can range from Fire to Thunder or even
                                Vozian
                                for infernal-themed traps.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Trap Customization Ideas</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Conditions:</strong> Add conditions like <em>Coughing</em>, <em>Prone</em>, or
                                <em>Blinded</em> to enhance the trap’s complexity.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Traps can be triggered by pressure plates, tripwires, magical
                                detection, or proximity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Themes:</strong> Adjust the theme of traps to fit your setting (e.g.,
                                jungle-themed
                                vine traps, steampunk clockwork mechanisms, or infernal traps with cursed effects).</li>

                        <p>During downtime, merchants can engage in activities that enrich the narrative and offer
                            unique
                            gameplay opportunities:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Establish new trade routes or expand operations into
                                untapped
                                regions. Success opens up new resources but may draw competition or attention from rival
                                factions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Crafting:</strong> Use skills like alchemy or blacksmithing to create unique
                                items.
                                High-quality or rare goods could attract buyers, leading to side quests or encounters.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> Broker deals, forge alliances, or settle disputes.
                                Successful
                                negotiations might provide discounts, rare materials, or political favor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Invest in goods or businesses to manipulate the economy.
                                Risk-reward scenarios can lead to significant profits—or devastating losses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infrastructure Projects:</strong> Build facilities like warehouses, workshops,
                                or
                                trade
                                hubs. These structures provide tangible benefits, such as faster crafting or increased
                                inventory
                                capacity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Merchant Intrigue:</strong> Hire spies or informants to gather intel on
                                competitors,
                                governments, or criminal organizations. This information could be leveraged for personal
                                gain or
                                to avoid conflict.</li>

                            <li><strong>Tier 4 (Influential):</strong> Political figures or guilds seek alliances;
                                rivals
                                become

            <h1>Damage Tables</h1>
            <p>When you roll a 20 or above on damage, this is termed a "success+". For every "success+" you achieve,
                you're
                granted a roll on the appropriate damage table specific to your weapon. Every 5 above 20 is an
                additional
                success+, so 25 would be 2 rolls, and 30 would be 3. It's vital to remember that different weapons come
                with
                distinct damage tables, so strategic weapon selection can offer unique advantages in combat.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Repeated Conditions</strong>: When you have a repeated, non-stacking condition you deal +1 damage
                instead</p>
            <h3>Special Values</h3>
            <li><strong>Cleave</strong>: deal the half damage to any other targetted creatures within melee range</li>

                                As a Tank, your character embodies the very essence of strength, resilience, and
                                unyielding
                                fortitude. You are the shield that safeguards your allies, the bulwark that stands firm
                                in
                                the
                                face of the enemy onslaught. With every swing of your weapon, you command the
                                battlefield,
                                drawing the attention of foes and absorbing their blows that would otherwise kill your
                                companions and many other creatures as well. Your unmatched stamina and formidable armor
                                make
                                you a veritable living fortress, capable of withstanding onslaughts that would
                                obliterate
                                the
                                less hardy.

                                However, the Tank's might in combat comes with a trade-off. In situations that require
                                finesse,
                                diplomacy, or arcane knowledge, you may find yourself akin to a fish out of water. While
                                your
                                strength and endurance are beyond question, tasks that involve subtlety, stealth, or
                                intricate
                                problem-solving might present a challenge. It's in these moments that you'll need to
                                rely on
                                your allies, just as they depend on your unwavering protection in battle. As a Tank,
                                your
                                role
                                is not to master every situation, but to provide a rock-solid foundation from which your
                                group
                                can confront any danger. Always remember, true strength comes not just from physical
                                power,
                                but
                                from knowing your limits and trusting in your comrades.

                                    Resonant Shadows are warriors attuned to the vibrations of reality, wielding sound

                                    their strikes, and warp the battlefield. By splitting their presence, they become a

                                    Mosshearts are living embodiments of nature's boundless power, blending the

                                    the earth with the regenerative properties of flora and fungi. These guardians of
                                    the
                                    wild
                                    harness the essence of the natural world to protect, heal, and fortify, creating a
                                    symbiotic
                                    bond between themselves and the life around them. A Mossheart's presence brings a
                                    sense
                                    of
                                    balance and harmony, offering allies not only support but also a connection to the

                                    beauty of nature. The Mossheart’s abilities go beyond simple healing or protection;
                                    they
                                    shape the battlefield into an extension of the natural world. Thorny barriers,

                                    blooms, and animated guardians form an arsenal as versatile as it is effective. They
                                    create
                                    opportunities to halt enemy advances, protect allies, or even transform the tide of

                                            momentarily, granting it additional movement options such as flying,
                                            swimming,
                                            or

                                            attacks for 1 minute.</li>

                                            gaining the ability to use your Off-Action (reaction) to impose disadvantage
                                            on
                                            attack rolls against it once per round.</li>

                                            basic
                                            decisions, have no limited range, and communicate simple concepts to you
                                            without
                                            direct control for 1 hour.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Puppet Master:</strong> You can have up to 3 puppets at one time.
                                            Your
                                            puppets are PL5 and can move up to a medium range from you.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Puppeteer's Veil:</strong> As an action, your puppets emit a veil of
                                            shadows
                                            that grant allies within reach range stealth advantage until the end of your

                                    Merchants can enhance their wealth by investing in businesses, which in turn

                                    Remember,
                                    running a business incurs operating costs. For instance, owning a stable implies
                                    expenses
                                    for horses, maintenance, etc. Though the system simplifies this aspect, players can
                                    further
                                    integrate their businesses into gameplay, using them as hubs or even hiring other

                                        Navigating the darker alleys of commerce, merchants can opt for underworld
                                        investments. While these ventures often require less upfront capital, they come
                                        with
                                        higher risks and potential consequences. The initial outlay and potential

                                        these illicit businesses are outlined in specific guidelines, varying by their
                                        scale
                                        and scope. Here are some example ventures:

                                        For those Merchants embroiled in the underworld, monthly profits are a dance
                                        with
                                        danger. Every in-game month, perform an Underworld Earnings check to gauge the
                                        illicit gains. The outcome can be swayed by the type of operation, its reach,
                                        the
                                        region's law enforcement vigilance, and unexpected events, such as rival gang
                                        confrontations or heists gone wrong.
                                    </p>

                                        Choose to roll either a d20 or d100 for this check. Take the result (as a
                                        percentage) and multiply it by your venture's potential monthly earnings to
                                        deduce
                                        your total token haul for the month. But remember, higher rewards often come
                                        with
                                        greater risks.

                                As a mage, you are a weaver of magic and a master of mysterious forces. Your power is
                                formidable, but it's also unpredictable, and you'll need a creative mind to control it.

                                Your magic can have both positive and negative outcomes, and it's crucial to learn how
                                to

                                recording
                                and
                                sharing your knowledge. Whether you pass on your wisdom through spellbooks or spiritual
                                knowledge transfer, your experiences and discoveries become a legacy for future
                                characters
                                you
                                play because they all share your soul.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Remember, as a mage, your journey is a balance of power and wisdom. Your potential is
                                enormous,
                                but the road to mastery is fraught with challenge. You're not merely casting spells -
                                you're
                                shaping reality. Choose your path wisely, and let your knowledge be your legacy.

                                        diverse
                                        as

                                        place

                                        the grand tapestry of the arcane, often standing in stark opposition to another.
                                        This
                                        opposition, far from being a source of conflict, is a testament to the balance
                                        that
                                        governs
                                        our universe.
                                        Arcane magic, the purest form of magical energy, stands in opposition to the
                                        unpredictable
                                        and often destructive Chaos magic. Basic magic, the foundation of all magical
                                        learning,
                                        finds its counter in the complex and time-bending Chronomancy which most regard

                                        plot bending of all magics. Celestial magic, drawing its power from the cosmos
                                        and
                                        heavenly
                                        bodies, is opposed by the ground-bound and ancient Vozian magic. Dragon magic, a
                                        powerful
                                        and ancient form tied to the mythical creatures themselves, is in opposition to

                                        magic, which draws its strength from the living world around us, and as many of

                                        dragons were the first of the outer planar beings to come to Shek. Elemental
                                        magic,
                                        harnessing the raw power of the natural n elements, stands in contrast to the
                                        refined
                                        and
                                        structured Crystal magic. Life magic, the nurturing force that promotes growth
                                        and
                                        healing,
                                        finds its counter in the mechanical and precise Tech magic.

                                        Understanding these oppositions is not merely an academic exercise. It is a
                                        journey
                                        towards

                                        that
                                        flow within it. As scholars of the arcane, we must strive to understand these
                                        relationships,
                                        not to exploit them, but to respect the delicate balance they represent and to
                                        harness
                                        our
                                        powers responsibly. Remember, dear students, in the grand scheme of the cosmos,
                                        opposition
                                        is not about conflict, but about balance and harmony.”

                                itself. Each mage draws from their own distinct source of power, shaping the spells they

                                <h3>Changelings</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Changelings are rare and mysterious creatures, often misunderstood due to their
                                    supernatural
                                    origins and extraordinary abilities. They are the result of ancient interference by
                                    fey,
                                    fiendish, or otherworldly beings, who swapped their progeny with human children.
                                    This
                                    heritage ties them deeply to chaotic realms, giving them the unique ability to alter
                                    their
                                    physical appearance.

                                    Changelings have a strange and fascinating presence in the world. Their ability to
                                    shift
                                    their form allows them to adapt to almost any situation, but it also alienates them
                                    from
                                    others. This power often leads to them being both feared and sought after, with some
                                    becoming spies, diplomats, or performers, while others are wrongly associated with
                                    criminal
                                    or deceitful activities.

                                            In the heart of the world's wild frontiers, where nature’s forces rage

                                            the Elemental Changelings were born. Their origins are the stuff of ancient

                                            tales of the world's formation and the spirits that shaped it.

                                            converse with the babbling brooks, and coax the very mountains to shift.

                                            ceremonies are spectacles of elemental mastery, where fire and water dance,

                                    Dwarves are a steadfast and industrious species group, renowned for their
                                    resilience,
                                    adaptability, and unparalleled craftsmanship. With deep cultural roots and a long
                                    history,
                                    Dwarves thrive in diverse environments both above and below ground. They are known
                                    for
                                    their
                                    expertise in stonework, mining, and metallurgy, as well as their ability to create
                                    intricate
                                    structures and durable artifacts.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Historically, Dwarves were integral members of a larger empire that united many
                                    species
                                    groups. However, they broke away following a dispute between their ruler, the Tyrant
                                    King,
                                    and the Emperor of the empire. This pivotal split shaped Dwarven culture, fostering
                                    an
                                    enduring sense of independence and self-reliance that continues to influence their
                                    society.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Dwarves are a common sight in underground cities, where their communities are
                                    structured
                                    around craftsmanship, trade, and a rigid adherence to tradition. Despite their
                                    inclination
                                    toward self-sufficiency, Dwarves are far from isolationist. Their goods and skills
                                    are
                                    highly sought after by other species, making them key contributors to the world’s

                                    Elves are a deeply adaptive group of species who evolve and adapt to their
                                    environments
                                    so
                                    thoroughly that they often become integral parts of the ecosystems they inhabit.
                                    Known
                                    for
                                    their grace, long lives, and connection to magic, Elves are a common thread in the
                                    folklore
                                    of many species, having played pivotal roles in the histories of others.

                                    Once considered integral members of the ancient empire, Elves have, in more recent

                                    stepped away from their roles as caretakers of other species to focus on
                                    rediscovering
                                    their own identity and purpose. This withdrawal has allowed them to embrace their
                                    individuality, but it has also splintered their communities into distinct groups,
                                    each

                                        Gloom Elves have adapted to life in shadowy and subterranean environments, where

                                        Vozian Elves are a dark and eerie Options shaped by their proximity to demons,

                                        In the dimly lit caverns deep below the world's surface, the Breaker Elves, or
                                        Gloom
                                        Elves, have carved a niche alongside the industrious Breaker Dwarves. As the
                                        epochs
                                        passed, these elves have come to share more than just the subterranean
                                        territories
                                        with
                                        the dwarves; they've adopted the Breaker mindset, embracing the intricate
                                        technologies
                                        and complex societal structures of their dwarven neighbors.

                                    <p>
                                        Long ago, the ancestors of the Breaker Elves sought refuge in the underground
                                        realms
                                        to
                                        escape a cataclysmic event on the surface. Over the centuries, their physiology
                                        adapted
                                        to the darkness, resulting in the evolution of their distinctive dark skin,
                                        which
                                        seamlessly blends with the shadows. Their ethereal hair, reminiscent of delicate
                                        spider
                                        silk, is a testament to their life away from the sun. The Breaker Elves, with
                                        their
                                        blend of elven grace and Breaker ingenuity, are a testament to the adaptability
                                        of
                                        life,
                                        proving that even in the harshest of environments, beauty and innovation can
                                        flourish.
                                        Their eyes are adapted to see in the infrared spectrum, allowing them to
                                        perceive
                                        temperature differences in their environment, which can be especially handy in
                                        detecting

                                <h3>Gnomes</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Gnomes are an inventive and endlessly curious group of species, known for their
                                    boundless
                                    imagination and the risks they often take in pursuit of knowledge. Once thriving in
                                    the
                                    Feywild, Gnomes were celebrated for their ingenuity and eccentricity. However, their
                                    curiosity took a dark turn with the rise of the Tinker Gnomes, who, in their pursuit
                                    of
                                    magical power, began harvesting dryad hearts to create cores for powerful
                                    constructs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When the atrocities came to light, the Feywild itself, under the guidance of Mother
                                    Nature,
                                    banished all Gnomes, marking them as exiles. Though the actions of the Tinker Gnomes
                                    were
                                    the cause, the punishment extended to the entire Gnomish people, forcing them to
                                    leave
                                    their
                                    home plane forever. This banishment left a deep mark on Gnomish culture, splitting
                                    them
                                    into
                                    those who seek redemption and balance with nature and those who fully embrace
                                    invention
                                    and
                                    progress, regardless of the cost.

                                <p>
                                    Despite their complicated past, Gnomes are fiercely determined to make their mark on
                                    the
                                    world. They are often seen as visionaries, tinkering with magical devices, crafting
                                    intricate machinery, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. While many
                                    Gnomes
                                    resent the mistakes of their ancestors, others see their exile as a challenge to
                                    prove
                                    that
                                    their ingenuity can benefit the world without repeating the sins of the past.

                                <h3>Kleinkind</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Small in stature but grand in spirit, the Kleinkind are a species as cozy as a
                                    well-worn
                                    quilt and as surprising as a jack-in-the-box. Often referred to as "Halflings" by
                                    outsiders,
                                    these delightful people weave a narrative claiming they were the first intelligent
                                    beings to
                                    grace the planet. Whether this is true or just a tale spun over a warm mug of cider,
                                    the
                                    Kleinkind hold their belief with pride (and no small amount of charm).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Kleinkind's hallmark is their love of community and comfort. Their villages are
                                    havens
                                    of merriment, where doors are always open, feasts are abundant, and every stranger
                                    is a
                                    friend waiting to be made. Their lives are painted with warmth and laughter, their
                                    hearths
                                    glowing as brightly as their spirits. But not all Kleinkind are content to stay
                                    within
                                    the
                                    snug borders of their idyllic enclaves. Some feel the pull of the road, a wanderlust
                                    that
                                    drives them to become Barnstormers—restless travelers who bring joy, stories, and
                                    just a
                                    touch of chaos wherever they go.

                                <p>
                                    Physically, Kleinkind are marvels of density. Standing no taller than 2 feet, they
                                    are
                                    far
                                    heavier than their size suggests, with compact musculature that makes them
                                    unexpectedly
                                    sturdy. A 1-foot Kleinkind can weigh up to 60 pounds, leading to many a startled
                                    adventurer
                                    who underestimated their strength. Despite their heft, they move with surprising
                                    nimbleness,
                                    like a stone rolling downhill—steady and unstoppable.

                                    Known as Core Bound or The Forged, these entities were originally crafted by gnome

                                    who transferred dryads from their natural habitats into engineered cores. This
                                    fusion of
                                    natural essence and mechanical engineering gave rise to sentient beings encased in
                                    armor,
                                    powered by the very core of nature itself. While they were initially used in warfare
                                    due
                                    to

                                    constructs lead full lives, capable of all human-like functions including emotional
                                    connections. Efforts continue among scholars to unlock and reclaim memories from the
                                    cores
                                    that might still linger from previous incarnations.

                                <p>
                                    The Ensuri are a mystical and enigmatic species, born from the union of humans and
                                    the primordial forces of the elements.
                                    Tracing their lineage back to the dawn of existence, the Ensuri embody the fierce
                                    power and untamed beauty of the natural world.
                                    Some among them hail from ancient families, their bloodlines intertwined with
                                    elemental spirits through sacred rites and ancient pacts.
                                    Others are the product of transformation, individuals who were altered by profound
                                    elemental events, forever changed by their exposure to raw elemental power.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With appearances as diverse as the elements themselves, the Ensuri possess traits
                                    reflective of their elemental heritage—skin that shimmers like the surface
                                    of a lake under moonlight for those of water lineage, or eyes that flicker with the
                                    undying flame of their fire ancestors. They are beings of both creation
                                    and destruction, capable of wielding their elemental powers with a natural ease that
                                    belies their human origins.

                                            they are the quintessential free spirits. Drawn to the mystical and

                                            believing that the wind is the breath of Khalas. Their culture is rich with

                                            tribes are known for their storytelling and vibrant festivals. They prefer
                                            light, airy foods such as soufflés, whipped cream, and fresh fruits,

                                <p>
                                    Born from the merging of demonic energy and mortal essence, Helborn are beings of
                                    profound power and mystique.
                                    Each Options reflects the distinctive traits of the nine layers of Ordealis,
                                    making them as diverse as they are formidable.
                                    Their appearance varies from the metallic hues of the Iron Dominion to the eerie
                                    glow of the Clockwork Abyss, symbolizing their otherworldly origins.
                                    Helborn possess abilities that echo the realms they are connected to, from
                                    manipulating memories and time to mastering the elements of ice and sound.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Despite being feared and often shunned by other species for their infernal heritage,
                                    many Helborn strive to transcend their ominous nature,
                                    proving that they can be as noble or malevolent as their choices dictate. Their
                                    society is complex, often shaped by the harsh realities of their birthright,
                                    yet enriched by a deep sense of kinship and survival.

                                            The Abyssal Helborn is a creature of darkness and otherworldly power. Its
                                            skin glows with the ethereal hues of twilight, and its body is adorned with
                                            sharp and asymmetrical horns.
                                            They are feared and shunned by society due to their otherworldly origins,
                                            but they possess a culture that is rich and mysterious. They are known to be
                                            powerful and formidable, but also
                                            quite reclusive, choosing to keep to themselves and their own kind.

                                        <p>
                                            They believe in the power of the abyss and are said to possess the ability
                                            to ensnare the souls of those they grapple with, drawing them into the
                                            abyss. Often viewed as loners, they can
                                            also be part of a tight-knit community. They are very protective of their
                                            own kind and will fiercely defend them if threatened. Some are quite wise
                                            and knowledgeable, possessing ancient
                                            secrets not shared with outsiders. They have a strong sense of pride and
                                            honor, with unwavering loyalty to their own.

                                <h3>Seraphim</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In the vast tapestry of existence, few beings hold as revered a position as the
                                    Seraphim. These celestial entities stand as shining paragons of devotion,
                                    embodying the zenith of spiritual commitment. To become a Seraphim is not merely an
                                    elevation in form but a testament to the unyielding faith and dedication
                                    one holds to their chosen deity or creed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many Seraphim were once mortals, fervent clerics and paladins who, through their
                                    unwavering service, found themselves transformed, touched by the divine essence
                                    of their deity. These chosen ones shed their mortal coil, ascending to a state of
                                    celestial grace, their very being infused with holy energy. Their previous lives
                                    as guardians of faith on the material plane set the foundation for their new
                                    existence as divine emissaries, bridging the gap between the heavens and the earthly
                                    realms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yet, not all Seraphim are born from acts of devout mortals. Ancient lineages of
                                    these celestial beings have existed since the dawn of time, chronicled in age-old
                                    scriptures and cosmic legends. These primordial Seraphim are believed to be the
                                    first of their kind, created by the gods themselves to serve as their most trusted
                                    advisors and guardians.

                                    origins and the physical realm.

                                    Their unique existence grants them unparalleled prowess in navigating dreams. Many,
                                    drawn by intrigue or purpose, have ventured into the waking world.
                                    Here, they find themselves endowed with the remarkable ability to delve into and
                                    influence the dreams of mortals, ranging from the most tranquil visions
                                    to the darkest of nightmares. This talent has made them both a beacon of fascination
                                    and a source of trepidation. While some seek them out for guidance
                                    through their own subconscious labyrinths, others view them with suspicion, wary of
                                    their potential to invoke tormenting nightmares.

                                    Despite their playful and often mischievous demeanor, these Etherians can exhibit
                                    unpredictable temperaments, especially if provoked. Their fluid nature
                                    makes them adept at blending into the world's myriad landscapes, yet a profound
                                    disconnect remains. Deep down, they grapple with understanding the unwavering
                                    certainties of the waking world, a stark contrast to the ever-shifting sands of the
                                    Dreamsea from which they emerged.

                                            The Dreamborn are a species of humanoid creatures born from the realm of
                                            dreams, the Dreamsea. They possess an ethereal and otherworldly presence,
                                            and are known for their fun-loving and joyful nature. Their mere presence
                                            has a way of bringing out the best in others, spreading positivity and joy
                                            wherever they go.
                                            They possess a unique ability to tap into the subconscious minds of those
                                            around them, interpreting and manifesting their deepest desires and fondest

                                            They can be familiar yet elusive, as if they are constantly drifting in and

                                            They are often seen as the embodiment of hope and inspiration, and are

                                            have the ability to manifest in the physical world to torment their victims.
                                            They possess a distorted and monstrous appearance, resembling twisted

                            <h3>Goblijjins</h3>
                            <p>
                                Deep within the annals of history, the Goblijjins emerged from the very essence of VoZo,
                                the Primordial Evil that once threatened to consume Shek.
                                Born of chaos and malevolence, their early ancestors were feared, loathed, and branded
                                as the living symbols of evil's persistence in the world.
                                Yet, time has a way of reshaping destinies, and the Goblijjins of today are a testament
                                to that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From the sprawling grasslands to the hidden alleyways of cities, Goblijjins have found
                                their place. While the shadow of their sinister lineage does loom
                                over them, the Goblijjins have strived hard to redefine themselves. But society, often
                                harsh and unforgiving, has rarely been welcoming. To most, Goblijjins are
                                still the remnants of an era best forgotten, and they face the brunt of that prejudice.
                                With the deck stacked against them, many Goblijjins embrace roles that benefit
                                the greater good, hoping to find a measure of acceptance. Yet, the world remains wary,
                                keeping them at arm's length.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In their heart of hearts, every Goblijjin struggles with their innate mischievous
                                nature. Whether it's a sly prank, a cheeky comment, or simply being a "little stinker,"
                                it's hardwired into their very being. It's not just a choice; it's a part of who they
                                are, a reminder of their tumultuous origin. This playful, sometimes disruptive,
                                behavior often gets them into trouble, further alienating them from other species. Their
                                names, often odd and humorous like "Snotbubble" or "Wiggletoe," are a reflection
                                of their unique culture and perspective on life. For a species with such a fleeting
                                lifespan, every moment is a celebration, every day a dance. There's a saying among
                                Goblijjins:
                                "Live for the giggle, for tomorrow we might not be here to hear it." And live they do,
                                with a fervor and zest that few can match.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the most distinct characteristics of the Goblijjins is their black, flaky blood.
                                When exposed to the air, it crystallizes and turns to ash, drifting away with the wind.
                                A poignant metaphor for their transient lives, perhaps. Despite the challenges they
                                face, the Goblijjins are a testament to resilience, adaptability, and the indomitable
                                spirit
                                to rise above one's origins. While the world may not always be kind to them, the
                                Goblijjins of Shek continue to carve out their place, one mischievous giggle at a time.

                                    The Goblins are the most prolific of the Goblijjin. Their rapid proliferation
                                    throughout the world is a testament to their adaptability and resilience.
                                    From the sprawling grasslands to the deepest, forgotten dungeons, one can find
                                    traces of these tenacious beings. Their language, a unique dialect known as
                                    "Gutter Common," stands as a symbol of their distinct identity, even if it's often
                                    misunderstood by others.

                                            In the vast stretches of Shek's untamed wilderness, the Wild Goblins thrive.
                                            These little rascals, often named with playful and bizarre monikers
                                            like "Gigglemud" or "Plopfoot", live in transient communities that rise and
                                            fall with the seasons. Their lives are a blend of mischief and survival,
                                            as they harness their innate cunning to navigate the challenges of the wild.
                                            Wild Goblins are known for their unyielding spirit and an uncanny ability
                                            to adapt quickly to their surroundings, making them elusive adversaries and
                                            curious allies.

                                            The bustling streets of Shek's cities are home to a different breed of
                                            goblins - the City Goblins. They have traded the vast open wilderness for
                                            the intricate
                                            labyrinths of urban life. Dressed in whatever finery they can acquire, often
                                            with an eccentric flair, these goblins are savvy traders, skilled artisans,
                                            and street-smart entrepreneurs.
                                            Their names often reflect their trades or peculiar habits, leading to
                                            goblins called "Silkthread" or "Dingledangle". Even in the cities, their
                                            mischievous nature shines,
                                            but it's tempered with a keen sense of business acumen.

                                    Hojgoblins, often considered the matured cousins of goblins, are a testament to
                                    evolution or perhaps a stroke of magical chance.
                                    Some say they were born of goblins who consumed enchanted fruits, while others argue
                                    they were deliberately shaped by arcane forces.
                                    Whatever the case, Hojgoblins have carved a niche for themselves as strategic
                                    masterminds and refined engineers. Their reputation precedes them;
                                    many war generals eagerly seek their counsel in battles, while cities benefit from
                                    their architectural prowess. Yet, with heightened intelligence comes a darker side.
                                    Some Hojgoblins find themselves on a perilous edge, where overthinking can spiral
                                    into madness. This duality of genius and potential instability makes them a complex
                                    and fascinating race in the world of Shek.

                                            Amid the untamed expanses, the Wild Hojgoblins reign supreme. Their tribes,
                                            refined in the crucible of nature, have developed sophisticated tactics that
                                            even
                                            the most advanced civilizations would envy. These Hojgoblins are not just
                                            survivors, but dominant forces in the wild. Their keen strategic minds,
                                            always a step ahead,
                                            combined with their raw physical prowess, make them a force to be reckoned
                                            with. To challenge a Wild Hojgoblin is to challenge the very essence of
                                            survival itself.

                                            The Vozian Hojgoblins are the shadowy enforcers of the night, born of an

                                            as they have honed their abilities to counter and disrupt magic. With skin
                                            tones reminiscent of either ash or twilight, they stalk the night, hunting

                            <h3>Giants</h3>
                            <p>
                                Giants, once formidable beings of incomprehensible might and stature, have become
                                entities shrouded in enigma and dark tales.
                                Thousands of years prior, their kind, the True Giants, were expelled or driven from the
                                prime material plane through a tumult of cosmic-scale events and ethereal politics
                                that were far beyond their control or comprehension. Yet, the ripple of their ancient
                                presence still lingers hauntingly across the lands, and their descendants, although
                                diminished,
                                tread cautiously in a world that has grown wary of their lineage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The True Giants, beings of incredible power and stature, were banished to the distant
                                realms by the celestial powers, forever locked away from the prime material plane due to
                                a cascade
                                of cataclysmic occurrences and divine interventions. Their banishment, wrought with
                                sorrow and wrath, echoed through the cosmos, leaving a scar in the collective memory of
                                all beings in Shek.
                                Even now, these giants, known as the "Banished", linger in their distant, secluded
                                realms, their hearts heavy with the burden of lost epochs and a deep yearning for the
                                world they were torn away from.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the contemporary epoch of Shek, those of giant lineage walk a precarious path,
                                ever-shadowed by the colossal specters of their ancestors. Three distinct species of
                                half-giants, each bearing
                                the diluted yet still formidable blood of their forebears, inhabit the world, each
                                uniquely adapted to their struggle for acceptance and survival amidst a populace that
                                regards them with a mixture
                                of awe and trepidation.

                                    tell a tale of a pact wrought from the abyss, trading loyalty for unfathomable
                                    power. Intimidation is their language, and through the shadows, they weave their

                                    casting a dark tapestry across the lands they tread. Yet, every pact bears a price,
                                    and within the fiery depths of their demonic alliances, the seeds of rebellion,
                                    redemption, or damnation silently sprout.

                            <h3>Dragons</h3>
                            <p>
                                In the epoch before recorded time, Shek was a tempestuous realm, constantly wracked by
                                the chaotic fury of the elements. This world, brimming with raw elemental potential,
                                was a cacophony of roaring thunder, raging infernos, surging tides, and howling gales.
                                It was during this tumultuous age that the God Dragon Khalas descended upon Shek,
                                drawn by the planet's untamed energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Khalas, a colossal being of indescribable magnificence, bore scales that shimmered with
                                the luminescence of a thousand stars. With wings vast enough to blanket entire
                                cities and eyes that held the wisdom of the cosmos, Khalas was a deity of unparalleled
                                power. As the mighty dragon landed, the storms themselves seemed to bow before
                                this majestic entity, waiting in bated anticipation. Drawing upon an ancient and arcane
                                rite, Khalas inhaled deeply, absorbing the wild elemental tempests that raged
                                across Shek. Every bolt of lightning, every lick of flame, every gust of wind, and every
                                crashing wave was drawn into the God Dragon's maw. The very fabric of the world
                                held its breath, and for a brief moment, an eerie calm descended upon Shek.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then, with an exhalation that resonated with the force of creation itself, Khalas
                                birthed the Crumbling Void. This vast expanse, a space where the elements met
                                and melded, became a canvas upon which new life would be painted. With each subsequent
                                breath, Khalas infused the void with fragments of the elements, giving birth
                                to the myriad species of dragons that would come to populate Shek.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From the fiery breath of Khalas came the Crimson Pyre Dragons, embodiments of flame and
                                fury. The cool exhalations birthed the Glacial Shard Dragons, masters of frost
                                and ice. The gentle sighs brought forth the Cloudburst Dragons, rulers of the skies and
                                storms. And so, with each breath, a new lineage of dragons was formed, each inheriting
                                a fragment of Khalas's elemental might.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the ages that followed, these dragons would go on to shape the history and destiny of
                                Shek. They carved out territories, established dynasties, and played pivotal roles
                                in the world's evolving narrative. Yet, they never forgot their divine origins, always
                                paying homage to Khalas, the God Dragon who breathed life into their kind.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though Khalas's physical presence has long since faded from Shek, the legacy of that
                                fateful day remains. The dragons, in all their elemental splendor, are a testament
                                to the God Dragon's creative force. They are not just creatures of myth and legend, but
                                living embodiments of Shek's primal history, forever soaring through its skies,
                                guarding its secrets, and shaping its future.

                                            transitioning to yellow on their underbelly, and
                                            they have forward-curving horns like a ram. Bile Dragons are cunning,

                                            friends, often attracting a retinue of ghosts and spirits.
                                            Despite their intimidating appearance, they're gentle giants who prefer
                                            companionship over conflict.

                                            Reaver Dragons are the largest of all these dragon types, their massive

                                            covered in metallic scales that gleam in the sunlight.
                                            They have large, curved horns and a thick, bladed tail that's as deadly as

                                            The largest of all dragons, the Crystal Wyrms are magnificent creatures with

                                            that resemble an array of gemstones, not limited to emeralds
                                            but including sapphires, rubies, and diamonds. These scales glint and

                                            like crystallized sculptures, and their tails are thick and blunted, used as

                                            powerful weapon. Crystal formations adorn their bodies, adding to their
                                            mystical appearance. Known for their wisdom and patience, these creatures
                                            often
                                            align themselves with the forces of balance and nature.

                                    As a Dragon Whelpling, you are a tiny beacon of wonder and potential. Your scales

                                    and your eyes hold a spark of innocence and curiosity. Despite being quite small,
                                    your presence holds an inherent dignity and sense of awe
                                    that few can resist. You are an enigma, your lineage unknown, your future uncertain.
                                    Whether you're a descendant of a mighty Elemental, a
                                    mystical Planar, the tenacious Neutral, the revered Metallic, or even the majestic

                                            As a Drakonari, you embody a mystifying fusion of man and dragon. Your
                                            existence is a riddle, a phenomenon that baffles many, born from the
                                            improbable union of the mundane and the mythical.
                                            You bear features of both lineages—scales glinting like armor, eyes glowing
                                            with ancient wisdom, and a humanoid form that stands tall and proud. Your
                                            voice carries an echo of draconic roars,
                                            and your breath hints at the elemental power inherited from your draconic
                                            parentage.

                                            With this awe-inspiring blend comes fear and unease. People are wary of your
                                            dragon lineage, and dragons are skeptical of your human side. But the
                                            potential within you is undeniable.
                                            How you wield this power, whether for good or ill, is your choice. Prove to
                                            the world that being a "bad dragon" means being extraordinarily formidable,
                                            not feared.

                                The Greenborn are a diverse collective of plant and fungal species, embodying the
                                vibrant, untamed spirit of nature itself. Rooted in the ancient magic of the natural
                                world, they serve as protectors, nurturers, and guardians of the verdant realms. Whether
                                thriving in shadowy forests, sunlit groves, or misty marshlands, the Greenborn are
                                intrinsically tied to the life force of the land they inhabit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each Greenborn carries a fragment of the world’s primal vitality, their existence a
                                living testament to the endless cycles of growth, decay, and renewal. From the towering,
                                immovable Husk Otaota to the enigmatic, spore-filled Ciuperca, they are as varied as the
                                ecosystems they call home. These beings are not merely part of nature—they are nature,
                                walking and breathing embodiments of the earth’s will.
                            </p>

                                While the Greenborn are often misunderstood or feared by other species, their wisdom
                                and connection to the land make them vital to maintaining the delicate balance of Shek’s
                                ecosystems. Through songs whispered on the wind, spores drifting through the air, or the
                                silent communion of roots beneath the soil, the Greenborn share a collective
                                consciousness that transcends words. They revere the ancient spirits of nature, honoring
                                their duty to protect the sacred groves, ancient forests, and untamed wilds that give
                                them life.

                                        The Thorn Otaota are the vigilant defenders of their kind, embodying the
                                        ferocity of nature's more aggressive
                                        elements. Their bodies are bristling with sharp thorns, a natural armor and
                                        weapon that reflects their unyielding
                                        resolve. Thorns are often found along the outer borders of Otaota territories,
                                        serving as sentinels and first-line
                                        defenders against intruders. They are fierce in battle, often intimidating
                                        enemies with their defiance and enduring
                                        even the harshest conditions to protect their kin.

                                        Though often seen as warriors, Thorns are more than just protectors. They are
                                        also cultivators of wild beauty,
                                        tending to resilient and hardy plants that thrive in difficult environments.
                                        Many Thorn Otaota paint their bark
                                        with natural dyes, adding to their fearsome appearance and creating living works
                                        of art that tell stories of their
                                        victories. Their bristling exterior hides a deeply rooted loyalty and love for
                                        their people, making them valued
                                        members of their communities.

                                    The Venin Otaota are enigmatic and feared, their very essence infused with toxic sap
                                    that flows like venom through their veins.
                                    Venin are the unseen protectors of the Otaota, often acting from the shadows to
                                    safeguard their people. Their sap, while deadly to foes,
                                    is sacred to their kind, symbolizing both the power of life and the inevitability of
                                    decay.

                                    effective. Their ability to commune with and command
                                    other plant life is revered within Otaota culture, as they can summon dense thickets
                                    or
                                    poisonous vines to entrap enemies or bolster defenses.

                                    In the deep, dark forests of the realm, a strange and ancient species of mushroom

                                    come to prominence.
                                    These sentient beings, known as the Fungi, have evolved over millennia to possess
                                    intelligence and will of their own.
                                    They are capable of communicating with one another through a complex system of
                                    spores
                                    and chemicals, and possess a
                                    deep understanding of the natural world around them. Some Fungi have even learned to
                                    harness the power of magic,
                                    using their unique physiology to cast powerful spells and curses. Though they are
                                    often

                                    the other races of the realm, the Fungi are a vital part of the ecosystem, and play

                                    crucial role in maintaining the

                                Symbiotes are an enigmatic and ancient species known for their unique ability to form
                                powerful bonds with various hosts.
                                They can be found in the darkest corners and most sacred spaces of the world, attracted
                                to beings with strong capabilities
                                and unique traits. They enhance their host's abilities while deriving sustenance and
                                other benefits from the bond. These
                                extraordinary creatures exist in various forms, such as the aggressive Parasitic
                                Symbiotes and the wise Eternal Worms.
                                Each symbiote offers a distinct set of skills and enhancements, making them highly

                                can handle the challenges and responsibilities of hosting such powerful beings. Their

                                    without causing harm to the host or the symbiote. If the check fails, the host and
                                    symbiote each take damage and may suffer
                                    from various conditions or penalties.

                                                    ability to double a check once per long rest.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Devourer:</strong> A host bonded through Devourer lasts for
                                                    one month or until the host dies.
                                                    To bond, the symbiote must win a contested Strength Check to
                                                    forcibly overtake the host's body. On a failure,
                                                    the host is immune to the Devourer while alive. Once bonded, the
                                                    symbiote enhances the host’s combat
                                                    capabilities, granting +1 to melee attack checks and damage.
                                                    Additionally, the host gains the ability to heal
                                                    themselves as an action for [[6 Healing]] or remove one Corpus

                                                <li><strong>Passenger:</strong> A host bonded through Passenger lasts
                                                    indefinitely, as the symbiote thrives
                                                    in secrecy without overtly harming the host. To bond, the symbiote
                                                    must succeed on a Stealth Check to
                                                    infiltrate the host’s body without their knowledge. Once bonded, the
                                                    Passenger can, as an action, grant the

                                                    take an aggressive action. This bond allows
                                                    the Passenger to act as a silent companion, leveraging the host’s

                                    Eternal Worms are a wise and ancient species of symbiote that have lived for
                                    centuries within various hosts. They are
                                    found in the sacred groves and ancient ruins where the barriers between the planes
                                    are thin. They have the ability to
                                    transfer their memories and experiences to their host, allowing them to benefit from
                                    a wealth of knowledge and skills,

                            <!-- Tristeţe (Lesser Vampire) -->
                            <details>
                                <summary>Tristeţe (Lesser Vampire)</summary>
                                <p>
                                    In the spectral hierarchy of strigoi, the Tristeţe are the outcasts, the forsaken.
                                    Their name, translating to 'sadness',
                                    poignantly mirrors their existence. These unfortunate vampires, transformed into
                                    lesser beings by disease, foul magic, or
                                    tragic incidents, bear grotesque deformities. Their skin, weak and light-sensitive,
                                    compels them to lurk in the shadows, away
                                    from the sun's harsh judgment and society's scorn. Immortal, their existence is an
                                    endless nocturnal cycle.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Shunned and often slain on sight, the Tristeţe survive by adopting disguises, their
                                    true forms concealed beneath layers of
                                    illusion. Despite their tragic circumstances, they outnumber their nobler
                                    counterparts, their prevalence a harsh testament
                                    to the vampire world's realities. Their deformed bodies, grotesquely resilient, can
                                    regenerate wounds unless exposed to
                                    sunlight or holy water. However, their light sensitivity is a severe weakness, with
                                    the sun's rays inflicting wounds that
                                    their bodies labor to heal. Holy symbols and radiant damage are particularly
                                    harmful, their unholy nature rendering them
                                    vulnerable to such forces.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Tristeţe embody the vampire legend's darker side, a stark contrast to the
                                    nobility and allure often associated with
                                    their kind. They are the forsaken, the deformed, the sorrowful, their existence a
                                    haunting reminder of the tragic
                                    possibilities lurking in the vampire world's shadows.

                                    In the shadowy realm of the undead, the Avuţie stand as the epitome of vampire
                                    nobility. They are the embodiment of the timeless
                                    allure and chilling dread that has become synonymous with the vampire legend. The
                                    Avuţie are not mere predators of the night,
                                    but sophisticated rulers who have held the reins of power for centuries. They have

                                    countless lifetimes, a testament to their cunning and influence. Despite their
                                    elegance and charm, the Avuţie are a chilling
                                    reminder of the true nature of the strigoi. They are as dangerous as they are
                                    alluring, their wealth and influence making
                                    them a formidable force in the world of the undead.

                                <p>
                                    The Tărie, the embodiment of raw, unyielding strength, are a formidable sight to
                                    behold. These Dravin-kin are the epitome of
                                    physical prowess among the strigoi, their bodies honed to perfection through
                                    centuries of relentless training and battle. Their
                                    skin, ashen and cold, is a stark contrast to the vibrant crimson of the blood that
                                    sustains them. Their eyes, a piercing silver,
                                    radiate an intimidating presence, a clear warning to any who dare to cross their
                                    path.

                                <p>
                                    Their wings, massive and powerful, are not just for show. They are fully functional,
                                    capable of carrying the Tărie into the sky.
                                    But these wings serve another purpose. They are strong and dexterous enough to wield
                                    additional simple melee weapons, turning the
                                    Tărie into a whirlwind of steel and fury on the battlefield. This unique ability
                                    allows them to engage multiple enemies at once.

                                    The Înviere are a haunting testament to the power of the undying, a species born
                                    from failed resurrections and ancient, mystical
                                    connections. Their existence is a paradox, caught between life and death, yet
                                    belonging to neither. They are the children of the
                                    Undying King and the Lord of Winter, Kharn, embodying the chilling touch of death
                                    and the relentless endurance of the cold.

                                    Their bodies bear the marks of their death and resurrection, making each Înviere a
                                    unique tapestry of life's end and its defiance.
                                    Their eyes glow with an eerie light, a beacon in the darkness they navigate so well.
                                    They move with purpose and intent, their
                                    actions driven by inscrutable goals known only to them and their undying deities.

                                    The Înviere are a striking sight to behold, their forms a chilling echo of the life
                                    they once lived. They bear the visage of their
                                    former humanoid selves, yet their skin is pallid and cold, ranging in tones from the
                                    lightest alabaster to the deepest ebony. Their
                                    bodies are often marked by the circumstances of their death, with scars, wounds, and
                                    other signs of their mortal end etched permanently
                                    into their flesh.

                                        The Greystone Gargoyles are the embodiment of ancient tradition and natural
                                        power. They are the descendants of the original
                                        gargoyle bloodline, born from the very stone of the earth. Their skin is as hard
                                        and unyielding as granite, and their bodies
                                        are built for endurance and strength. Despite their heavy build, they are
                                        capable of flight, a skill they use to patrol their
                                        territories and protect their kin. They have the unique ability to regenerate
                                        their bodies, healing wounds and injuries at a
                                        remarkable rate when they remain still. They are a rare and respected species,

                                        and the protectors of their kind.

                                    Zoanthropes, also known as shifters or half-men, are a unique species of creatures
                                    that possess both human
                                    and animal traits. They are neither wholly human nor wholly animal, placing them
                                    outside of society's norms
                                    and conventions. They have the ability to shift between human and animal forms, a
                                    skill that sets them apart
                                    and makes them both fascinating and feared. Known for their strong connections to
                                    the natural world, they
                                    possess heightened senses, strength, and agility. While revered by some cultures as
                                    protectors of the natural
                                    world, they are often ostracized and discriminated against, seen as freaks and
                                    outsiders. They frequently form
                                    tight-knit communities where they can find acceptance among their own kind.

                                        They are skilled hunters, often preying on meat to sustain themselves. Rarely
                                        found in cities, they prefer a tribal
                                        lifestyle where they can hunt and roam freely. Fierce and powerful, they are
                                        often seen as protectors of their tribe.

                                        for their speed and agility, they can outrun and outmaneuver threats with ease.
                                        Peaceful and gentle by nature,
                                        they are fiercely loyal to their tribe and become formidable when threatened.

                                        they are considered protectors of the forest.

                                        such as fish or marine mammals. Equipped with powerful fins, gills, and webbed

                                        The Satyrs are a mystical and mischievous breed of shifters, deeply tied to the
                                        feywild and the untamed forces
                                        of nature. Often mistaken for beastmen, Satyrs possess a unique blend of
                                        humanoid intelligence and feral
                                        instinct. With goat-like features such as cloven hooves, small horns, and nimble
                                        frames, their true essence lies
                                        in their connection to the fey.

                                        Natural performers and instigators, Satyrs thrive in chaos and revelry, wielding
                                        haunting melodies and
                                        captivating charm to influence others. Despite their playful demeanor, they are
                                        fiercely protective of their kin
                                        and the wilds they call home. Often found in ancient groves or hidden fey
                                        crossings, they act as guardians and
                                        emissaries of their enigmatic fey ancestry.

                                        Centaurs are proud and noble shifters, blending the strength of their equine
                                        heritage with the sharp wit and
                                        determination of their humanoid form. Known as tireless hunters and warriors,
                                        they roam the expansive
                                        grasslands and plains they call home. Centaur society revolves around freedom
                                        and duty, with members acting
                                        as both protectors and providers for their community.

                                        In a bitter conflict with the Hellborn Minotaurs over the Thundering Plains,
                                        Centaurs view this battle as a fight
                                        for the survival of their way of life. Agile and fast, they are unmatched in
                                        endurance and maneuverability,
                                        revered as guardians of the plains. Skilled artisans and storytellers, Centaurs
                                        preserve their rich history
                                        through oral tradition and symbolic art, drawing strength from their connection
                                        to nature and the open skies.

                                            by the dragon goddess Tiamat to wage war against her rivals, these
                                            half-human, half-scorpion beings have
                                            since gained independence. Now residing in the Red Desert, they live

                                            insect-like Scarab Lords. With their human upper body and scorpion lower

                                            strength, agility, and an additional pair of pincers that can hold
                                            objects or be used as weapons. Known

                                        Spiderkin are a unique species of humanoids characterized by their lean,
                                        thickly haired bodies and large
                                        mandibles. Their mandibles make speaking the common tongue difficult, yet
                                        they have adapted to communicate
                                        effectively. Females of the species are known for their powerful builds and
                                        combat abilities, while males
                                        are agile and often skilled in magic. Fiercely loyal to their tribes, they
                                        are commonly found in wooded or
                                        mountainous regions where they spin webs for hunting and protection. Many
                                        Spiderkin have found work in
                                        libraries, weaving intricate web systems to categorize and organize
                                        knowledge.

                                        Tikkin are a small, elusive species known for their need to survive on
                                        blood. With small statures and sharp fangs,
                                        they feed on the blood of other creatures. Despite their unique dietary
                                        requirements, Tikkin are not inherently
                                        violent, often finding non-harmful methods to sustain themselves. However,
                                        their nature leads to societal rejection,
                                        forcing them to live in the shadows. Fiercely protective of their
                                        communities, Tikkin have developed a strong sense
                                        of loyalty and care for their own kind. Some have learned to control their
                                        blood thirst, while others struggle to
                                        overcome their instincts.

                                    connect them to the skies.
                                    Adapted to various climates and cultures across the world, they range from proud
                                    hawk-like warriors to peaceful
                                    dove-like diplomats, each embodying unique avian traits. Their cities, suspended
                                    among the clouds or perched atop
                                    towering peaks, are marvels of architecture, blending natural beauty with
                                    engineering precision. These skybound
                                    civilizations are steeped in ancient feathered traditions, including the sacred
                                    "Molting Ceremony," where feathers
                                    lost in combat or hardship are ritually honored as symbols of resilience.

                                    Avians are natural navigators, known for their ability to traverse great distances
                                    with ease, making them revered
                                    messengers and scouts. While fiercely protective of their aerial territories, Avians
                                    often serve as bridges between
                                    grounded civilizations, bringing knowledge, trade, and diplomacy from one land to
                                    another. Their language, Naech
                                    (or Trill), is a melodic combination of chirps, whistles, and harmonics that echoes
                                    their heritage. As guardians of
                                    the skies and keepers of the winds, Avians hold their ancient traditions as dearly
                                    as they do their freedom, soaring
                                    through history as symbols of unity and wisdom.

                                        Huginn are intelligent crows, while those under Muninn are ravens cursed by a
                                        fey deity with perfect memory,
                                        though they can only speak in mimicry if they choose to. This duality of
                                        intelligence and memory has led them to
                                        thrive in roles as court reporters, spies, and stage performers. Often found in

                                        to gather information, navigate social hierarchies, and make a living. Skilled

                                        they are fiercely loyal to their families and communities. Their society is

                                        The Passerine humanoids, also known as Swift Avians, are small but mighty birds
                                        known for their quickness, agility,
                                        and bright, colorful feathers. Their small size allows them to maneuver through
                                        tight spaces, dense forests, and
                                        crowded cities with ease. Adventurous and social, Passerines love exploring new
                                        places and meeting new people, making
                                        them natural messengers and scouts.

                                        from their travels. Their communication
                                        style includes a complex system of chirps, songs, and body language, making
                                        their interactions lively and expressive.
                                        Their ability to manipulate air currents with their wings enables them to glide
                                        effortlessly, navigate dangerous

                                    <p>
                                        Penguins are a unique subspecies of avian beastmen, adapted to life in cold
                                        coastal regions and the open ocean.
                                        Though flightless, they are exceptional swimmers and agile divers, capable of
                                        navigating icy waters with unmatched
                                        grace. Known for their tightly-knit communities, they build intricate ice
                                        villages along glacial coasts, fortified
                                        against the harsh elements. Penguins hold deep cultural reverence for the
                                        "Eternal Ice," an ancient tradition
                                        celebrating resilience, teamwork, and the bond between the sea and the sky.
                                        These ceremonies involve synchronized
                                        dances and storytelling by elder penguins, recounting legendary migrations and
                                        ocean spirits.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Penguins have strong protective instincts, working cooperatively to guard their
                                        homes from predators and environmental
                                        dangers. Their natural resilience and physical adaptations make them excellent
                                        aquatic scouts, fierce protectors, and
                                        invaluable allies in both the sea and icy terrains. Despite their smaller
                                        stature and inability to fly, penguins
                                        exemplify determination, resourcefulness, and a profound connection to the
                                        ocean's mysteries.

                                    the world. They have unified on the island of Beruklian, where they have developed a

                                    society. Due to the island's dense population, towering high-rise structures have
                                    been constructed to house their
                                    vibrant culture. The city is a bustling hub of trade, commerce, and education, with
                                    a deep respect for hierarchy and
                                    order reflected in every aspect of their society. Even when Beruklians leave the

                                    <h3>Lupine (Alpha)</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The Lupine (Alpha) subspecies are proud, fiercely loyal leaders, easily
                                        recognized by their striking coats of pure
                                        white or jet black—a mark of their lineage, said to descend from Fenris
                                        themself. Their heritage ties them to
                                        ancient tales of bravery and ferocity, with some Alphas claiming to carry
                                        Fenris’s wild spirit within them. Alphas
                                        are natural-born leaders, often serving as pack heads, tribal chiefs, or war
                                        commanders. While their hot-headed
                                        nature can lead to brash decisions, their determination and unwavering loyalty
                                        inspire those who follow them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In the wild, Alphas are exceptional hunters, using their keen senses to track
                                        prey and enemies alike. Their booming
                                        howls, resonant and commanding, rally their allies and strike fear into foes.
                                        Despite their impulsive tendencies,
                                        Alphas hold a deep responsibility for their pack’s well-being, often putting
                                        themselves at risk to protect their
                                        kin. They embody both the strength and flaws of their legendary ancestor.

                                    The Cloven are a proud and reclusive species of humanoid beastmen, characterized by
                                    their cloven hooves and shaggy
                                    fur. Native to mountainous regions, they live in small, tight-knit communities.
                                    Despite their gruff exterior, Cloven
                                    are fiercely loyal to their families and will go to great lengths to protect them.
                                    They are excellent hunters and
                                    trackers, relying on their keen senses and agility to survive in harsh environments.

                                    reckless abandon. While generally wary of outsiders, they can be formidable allies
                                    to those who earn their trust. The
                                    Cloven are a noble species, and encounters with them are rarely forgotten.

                                        The Caprakin are hardy and tenacious humanoid beastmen, thriving in steep, rocky
                                        landscapes where their agility and
                                        balance are unparalleled. Known for their bold nature and fierce independence,
                                        they are often found in mountainous
                                        regions, grazing on natural grasses and defending their tight-knit communities
                                        with vigor. Despite their aloof demeanor,
                                        Caprakin hold strong loyalty to their herds and ancestral lands.

                                        Legends of the Caprakin tell of their defiance against invaders, using their
                                        mountainous homes as natural fortresses to
                                        repel stronger foes. Their haunting war cries echo through the cliffs,
                                        instilling fear and awe in those who hear them.
                                        Caprakin culture values resilience, storytelling, and a deep connection to the
                                        land. Climbing competitions and feats of

                                        battle. Born on windswept plains, they embrace the thrill of the hunt, pursuing

                                        determination. While their infernal heritage often casts them in a sinister

                                        toward protecting their kin or carving out territories to ensure survival.

                                        Some Hellhorns seek redemption, striving to break free from their dark heritage,

                                        Cervidae are elegant and swift Cloven beastmen, known for their connection to
                                        the forest and their strong sense of
                                        community. With antlers that grow in intricate patterns, they serve as
                                        protectors of ancient groves and champions of
                                        nature. While they are wise and peaceful, they can become fierce defenders when
                                        their homes are threatened.

                                    The Felidae are a diverse and proud race of feline humanoid creatures found in

                                    Known for their agility, strength, and keen senses, they are skilled hunters and
                                    warriors. Felidae have a strong sense
                                    of community, often establishing territories where they live and work together in
                                    harmony. Their society is deeply
                                    rooted in loyalty and kinship, with every member contributing to the wellbeing of
                                    the whole.

                                    Felidae typically stand between 4-7 ft tall, with slender, muscular bodies and a
                                    wide range of fur colors and patterns,
                                    including stripes, spots, and solid colors. Their faces resemble those of large
                                    cats, with pointed ears, sharp teeth,
                                    and distinctive whiskers. They have large, expressive eyes, well-adapted for
                                    low-light vision, and their overall
                                    appearance exudes both grace and strength.

                                    Felidae culture is steeped in tradition and a deep connection with the natural
                                    world. They have a profound respect for
                                    nature's balance and often live in harmony with their surroundings. Skilled hunters
                                    and trackers, they rely on their
                                    innate abilities to stalk and catch prey. Additionally, Felidae have a strong
                                    affinity for music and storytelling,
                                    with folklore passed down through generations in the form of songs and tales.

                                    Felidae society is divided into close-knit communities called prides, usually led by
                                    a dominant individual or a small
                                    group of leaders. These prides consist of families and friends who work together to
                                    protect their territory and meet
                                    the group's needs. Felidae are fiercely loyal to their pride and will go to great
                                    lengths to defend it from external
                                    threats.

                                        Living primarily in the coastal regions around the Vozian Sea, the Paka are
                                        masterful sailors, traders, and
                                        artisans. Their maritime culture thrives on exploration, trade, and
                                        craftsmanship, with their ships doubling as
                                        floating galleries of intricate carvings and vibrant colors. Once rulers of
                                        ancient kingdoms, the Paka now live in
                                        communities shaped by the remnants of their lost empires, blending nostalgia
                                        with resilience. Despite the loss of
                                        their lands to the Ostrio Empire, the Paka remain resourceful, using their sharp
                                        wits and social acumen to thrive
                                        in a competitive world.

                                        The Kivuli, or Panthari, are enigmatic and elusive Felidae, often called the
                                        "Shadows of the Jungle." Living in dense
                                        forests or hidden enclaves, they are masters of stealth and ambush tactics.
                                        Their black or darkly patterned fur allows
                                        them to blend seamlessly with their surroundings, making them nearly invisible
                                        in low light. Kivuli culture revolves
                                        around safeguarding ancient knowledge and defending sacred jungle sites. While
                                        they prefer to remain unseen, their
                                        swift and precise strikes leave an unforgettable mark on those who threaten
                                        their home.

                                        regions with unmatched stealth and agility.

                                        The Hippokin are contemplative and wise, resembling humanoid hippopotamuses.
                                        Known for their love of rivers and
                                        marshlands, they are natural swimmers and builders, often constructing homes
                                        along waterways. Hippokin are revered
                                        for their intellect and ingenuity, focusing on crafting, invention, and the
                                        exchange of ideas. Their communities serve
                                        as hubs for trade and knowledge, enriching their regions with innovation.

                                        Hippokin take pride in their calm and measured demeanor, often acting as
                                        mediators and problem-solvers. However, when
                                        roused to action, their immense strength and nearly impenetrable hide make them
                                        formidable opponents. Hippokin warriors
                                        are known for using water as a tactical advantage, drawing enemies into terrain
                                        they control.

                                        Resembling humanoid elephants, they are
                                        renowned for their exceptional memories, which they use to preserve history,
                                        culture, and craftsmanship. Elephantine
                                        communities are often led by matriarchs or councils of elders, guiding their
                                        people with wisdom and compassion.

                                        and protectors of sacred sites. Their

                                <h3>Gliers</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The Gliers are small, swift, and resourceful beastmen who embody boundless energy
                                    and unrelenting curiosity. These
                                    diminutive humanoids are as diverse in appearance as they are in culture, with each
                                    option drawing unique traits from
                                    the small mammals they resemble. Gliers thrive on their quick wits, nimble
                                    movements, and a natural talent for adapting
                                    to their surroundings. Though often underestimated due to their size, their
                                    ingenuity and industrious nature have
                                    earned them a place in nearly every corner of the world.

                                <p>
                                    Gliers’ communities reflect their individualistic yet cooperative spirit. While some
                                    prefer the safety of forests,
                                    rivers, or burrows, others wander endlessly, drawn by the thrill of discovery. Their
                                    quick speech and fast-paced lives
                                    often leave larger creatures struggling to keep up. Yet, for all their restlessness,
                                    Gliers form deep bonds with those
                                    they trust, standing by their allies with fierce loyalty. Whether crafting gadgets,
                                    hoarding treasures, or exploring
                                    unknown lands, the Gliers bring vibrancy and cleverness to all they touch.

                                        The Leporidae have a dark past. For a long time, both the Leporidae and

                                        feet of these creatures provided a luck bonus. This history shifted the nature
                                        of the Leporidae, and they now stick to
                                        the underground as much as possible. Despite this, Leporidae remain humble and
                                        happy travelers, seeking friendship and
                                        love wherever they go.

                                        Standing between 4-5 ft tall, Beavers have stocky bodies covered in thick,
                                        waterproof fur in shades of brown. They are
                                        easily identified by their large, flat tails and powerful front teeth capable of
                                        cutting through wood with ease.
                                        Beavers also have small, rounded ears and dark eyes.

                                        Beaver communities are often found near rivers and lakes, where they construct
                                        elaborate dams and lodges using their
                                        natural engineering talents. Highly organized and efficient, they work together
                                        to build impressive structures that
                                        provide safety and comfort for their families. Beavers have a strong sense of
                                        community and cooperation, often working
                                        alongside other races on large-scale construction projects.

                                        of natural reserves, they are defenders of endangered ecosystems. Their ability
                                        to curl into a ball makes them nearly
                                        impervious to harm.

                                        Pangolin communities are highly secretive, living in remote, forested regions.
                                        Seen as keepers of ancient natural
                                        wisdom, their scales are often inscribed with symbols representing the cycles of
                                        life and nature.

                                    Reptilia typically stand between 5-7 ft tall, with bodies covered in tough, scaly
                                    skin that comes in a variety of

                                    slit-like eyes. Some Reptilia have
                                    tails, while others possess frills, crests, or spines along their bodies. Their
                                    limbs are strong and muscular, with
                                    clawed fingers and toes.

                                    foragers. While often stoic and reserved, they form strong bonds with others and are

                                    and communities.

                                Yeeshnu. This alliance of Gnolls,
                                Scourge, and Vulturkin represents the embodiment of plague and destruction, united in
                                their worship of their deity.
                                While each species is formidable on its own, together they form an unstoppable force of
                                strength, cunning, and mysticism.

                                The gnolls are fierce warriors, known for their immense strength and ferocity in battle.
                                The scourge are numerous and
                                cunning, using their vast numbers to overwhelm enemies. The vulturkin, on the other
                                hand, are powerful mystics, able to
                                wield and control the very essence of the plague itself. This trinity often leads cults
                                of plague-worshippers, granting
                                them boons in exchange for their devotion to Yeeshnu.

                                Members of the Trinity are outcasts in civilized lands, often killed on sight due to the
                                diseases they carry and the
                                fear they inspire. Playing as a member of the Trinity is a unique challenge, as their
                                presence will be met with caution
                                and distrust, even from allies.

                                    allies.

                                    Yeeshnu. Renowned for their intelligence and
                                    cunning, they are often found infiltrating and manipulating other societies to
                                    achieve their goals. Omnivorous by
                                    nature, they will eat almost anything but show a preference for meat. The
                                    Scourge maintain a highly organized society
                                    ruled by the powerful Council of Nine, a leadership body that directs their
                                    collective actions.

                                    Also known as the Sky Plague, the Scavengers are mystic beings born from the
                                    plague. They are deeply connected to death
                                    and the afterlife, often serving as spiritual leaders and guides for their
                                    fellow Gnolls and Scourge. Known for their
                                    elaborate burial rituals and ceremonies, they maintain a strong sense of
                                    community and tradition.
                                </p>

                                    Scavengers are carrion eaters, relying on their powerful beaks and talons to
                                    strip flesh from carcasses. Despite their
                                    ominous reputation, they are valued for their spiritual insights and their
                                    ability to commune with the spirits of the
                                    dead.

                                Size in the world of adventuring isn't merely a matter of height and weight; it's a
                                key
                                factor in determining how a creature interacts with its environment and other
                                beings.
                                From the tiniest insect skittering unseen beneath a leaf to the towering giants
                                striding
                                across mountain ranges, size affects reach, stealth, strength, and vulnerability. A
                                creature's size can determine the spaces it can traverse, the opponents it can
                                challenge, and the impact of its presence in any given situation. In a realm of
                                magic
                                and might, understanding size is crucial for survival and success.

                            <p>
                                In the realm of Shek, gender is as varied as the landscapes that stretch from
                                soaring
                                peaks to deep mystical forests. Here, identity is not just male or female but also
                                includes the enigmatic dragon. Dragons, with their ancient magic, can fluidly shift
                                to
                                align with the souls of those they cherish. The changelings too, with their
                                transformative abilities, are not bound by any single form. In Shek, it's a gentle
                                reminder for all: never assume, for identity is a personal journey, unique as the
                                being
                                who walks its path.

                <h2>Spellcasting</h2>
                <p>
                    In the intricate dance of spellcasting, every movement and utterance matters. A mage must channel
                    their intentions through voice and gesture, like a maestro guiding an orchestra. Yet, magic demands
                    clarity. If a caster finds themselves silenced or restrained, the symphony of magic halts. Even
                    their gear plays a role; while hands must be free as the wind, a shield may hinder, and armor can
                    stifle the very currents of magic they seek to harness.
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Spellcasting requires voice and gesture. Restraints or
                            silence hinders magic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Casting:</strong> Make a Spellcasting check. If you lack a specific Spellcasting
                            check, use a Spirit check. Spells generally require an action to cast or double the spell
                            points for half-actions or off-actions. Add +1 to no-cast spells.</li>
                        <li><strong>Targeting:</strong> Requires sensory perception of the target.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spell Points:</strong> Recover 1 when you press on and all on a long rest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Requires a minimum Spirit check of 2, granting 1 spell
                            point.</li>

                    suitable for subtle, immediate effects.

                        profound <strong>how</strong> and <strong>what</strong> of your magical endeavors.

                    <h3>Spell Calculation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some spellcasters prefer to calculate the true cost of a spell to develop a stronger connection
                        with their magic. The intent system is fine, but they want precise control. Here are the tables
                        and information for spell calculation.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Spells vs. Abilities -->
                    <h4>Spells vs. Abilities</h4>
                    <p>
                        All magical effects aren't created equal. While some creatures are innately resistant or immune
                        to certain spells, they might still be susceptible to others, depending on their inherent
                        magical defenses or capabilities. The distinction between what constitutes a spell and what
                        doesn't often lies in the essence of its origin.
                        <br>
                        For instance, a hag's enchantment or a lich's spell is undeniably magical. Conversely, a
                        dragon's fiery breath or the enchantment of a magical sword isn't necessarily a "spell." It's
                        crucial for the Narrator to discern these differences, tailoring their decisions to the
                        situation at hand.

                    <h4>Spellcasting Notes</h4>
                    <h5>Death Condition in Dynamic Magic</h5>
                    <p>
                        To impose the death condition via spellcasting, a significant investment of spell points is
                        required. Costs are determined by the combination of high-cost Manner and Transmission words.
                        Upon casting, the afflicted target can attempt a survival check to resist the spell's effects on
                        their turn. Success depends on the difficulty set by the Narrator, potentially influenced by the
                        target's attributes or the spell's strength.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of the death condition spell is carefully regulated by the Narrator to maintain balance
                        and narrative tension, particularly during pivotal encounters. It should not be a trivial or
                        dominant strategy but a deliberate choice with appropriate risks and costs. The death condition
                        may also result from zero wounds, subsequent injury, and further damage, creating a layered
                        approach to combat and spellcasting consequences.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Spell Duration -->
                    <h4>How Long a Magic Condition Lasts</h4>
                    <p>
                        In Dynamic Magic, spell duration is influenced by the nature of the spell and the caster's
                        intent. Temporary spells, like those causing prone or pinned conditions, last until the target
                        counters them, such as standing up or making a strength check. These spells can become a battle
                        of wills, with the caster needing to concentrate to maintain their effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More severe spells, like those causing broken bones, have longer-lasting impacts that require
                        medical or magical healing. Permanent spells, like those altering terrain or creating objects,
                        remain without ongoing caster focus. Spell duration reflects the caster's purpose, the spell's
                        character, and the balance within the magical world, with some spells easily countered and
                        others leaving lasting effects.

                            broadswords, requiring brute force for impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agility-Based Weapons:</strong> Lightweight weapons like daggers, rapiers, and bows,
                            relying on finesse and precision.</li>

                            Firearms are rare and powerful tools in our world, often viewed with suspicion due to their
                            potential for destruction. Most cities and populated areas regulate or even ban their use.
                            Carrying a firearm openly attracts attention, especially from law enforcement or bandits.
                            While
                            firearms provide immense firepower, they come with risks and consequences. If you choose to
                            wield one, do so wisely and carefully.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Armor</h3>
                        <p>
                            When adventuring, armor is your primary line of defense. It's essential to ally with a
                            blacksmith who can repair and upgrade your gear. In combat, armor absorbs hits before they
                            affect your health. Remember, armor is not destroyed when its protection points are
                            depleted; it
                            simply can't offer protection until repaired.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Armor also shields against poison, as venom requires direct contact with the skin to be
                            effective. Be cautious, as wearing too much heavy gear can impose the 'pinned' condition,
                            hindering your movement.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Bulk represents the weight and space your gear occupies, from negligible trinkets to
                            burdensome
                            hauls. It's not just about weight but also the size and how cumbersome an item is. Managing
                            your
                            bulk is crucial for maintaining agility and avoiding encumbrance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, a watch has 0 Bulk because it can be worn and forgotten about. Meanwhile, an
                            empty
                            barrel may be light but is awkward to carry, giving it a Bulk of 5.

                            grabbing a
                            potion.

                    <h2>Mounted Combat</h2>
                    <p>Mounted combat stands as a thrilling fusion of tradition and innovation. Knights and daredevils
                        alike
                        take to the streets and skies, not on horses, but on mechanized steeds and mystical creatures.
                        Here,
                        a well-timed cavalry charge might be led by a line of sleek motorcycles, while Pegasus-mounted
                        aces
                        could duel among the skyscrapers. In this era, the mounted warrior's valor is matched only by
                        the
                        speed of their mount, be it flesh or steel, feathered or geared.</p>

                    <h3>Rules for Mounted Combat</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mount Movement:</strong> The base speed for beasts of burden such as horses is 60
                            ft.
                            Speed for other creatures used as mounts will be determined based on their type and size.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Target Selection:</strong> Enemies may choose to direct their attacks at either you
                            or
                            your mount.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dismounting & Mounting:</strong> Exiting your mount requires either the expenditure
                            of
                            20 ft of movement or an action, and the same for mounting a creature or vehicle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mount Abilities:</strong> Different types of mounts provide various abilities and
                            combat
                            options. For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Warhorse:</strong> Might grant a charge ability that allows for a powerful
                                    attack after moving a certain distance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Flying Mount:</strong> Could offer aerial movement options, but with
                                    limitations
                                    on how long they can stay aloft or how they maneuver.</li>
                                <li><strong>Aquatic Mount:</strong> May allow for swift underwater movement and possibly
                                    an
                                    evasion bonus due to the fluid environment.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Crafting</h2>
                    <p>In the world of Shek, crafting armor and weapons requires a Forge Workbench, materials (purchased
                        or
                        scavenged), and skilled hands. Existing mundane items can also be repurposed into new items,
                        such as
                        converting heavy armor into medium armor or reshaping medium armor into a weapon.</p>

                    <h3>Forge Workbench</h3>
                    <p>A Forge Workbench is essential for crafting and includes a main station where the crafter makes
                        their
                        Crafting check. Up to three allies can assist the main crafter using different workstations,
                        each
                        contributing with their skills.</p>

                        <li><strong>Making Checks:</strong> The main crafter and allies at workstations each make their
                            respective checks. The total number of successes determines the item’s quality.</li>

                        <h2>Glyphs</h2>
                        <p>Glyphs are powerful symbols infused with magic, capable of granting weapons, armor, and even
                            characters with remarkable abilities and enhancements. Through glyphs, a simple piece of
                            gear
                            can become a legendary artifact, and a character may access abilities that significantly
                            alter
                            their role and capabilities within the game.</p>

                        <h3>Crafting and Application</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Crafting and applying glyphs require specific materials
                                and
                                a suitable crafting station, such as an enchanting table or magical lab. The rarity of
                                materials and quality of the station can affect the outcome.</li>
                            <li><strong>Crafting Process:</strong> Crafters must perform Crafting, Intellect, Spirit, or
                                other related checks. The complexity of the glyph determines the number of successes
                                required.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Process:</strong> Applying a glyph involves a similar check to
                                integrate
                                the glyph's magical essence fully. Each step takes one hour, with more complex glyphs
                                requiring additional time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Risk of Failure:</strong> Failed crafting or application checks can damage or
                                destroy the item, with consequences scaling based on the severity of the failure.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Curses</h2>
                <p>Curses add an exciting layer of strategy, tension, depth, and complexity to gameplay. By placing a
                    curse on a character or item, players must weigh the risk versus reward of using it or benefiting
                    from the curse's effects. While curses can grant powerful abilities or bonuses, they often come with
                    significant drawbacks, creating a dynamic gameplay experience. Curses are not always malicious; they
                    can stem from angels, tech lords, or other sources, adding an element of unpredictability and
                    customization to the game.</p>

                <h3>Curse Progression</h3>
                <p>Curses work similarly to Paths and Talents. Players can spend XP to gain features from a curse, often
                    at a steep cost. Some curses require players to acquire bane features before unlocking powerful
                    boons. Curses offer a blend of complexity and customization, allowing characters to evolve uniquely.

                                <li><strong>Branded By Words:</strong> Your body is marked by glowing scripts of ancient
                                    languages, creating discomfort and distraction. However, these scripts faintly
                                    illuminate the area around you, providing a soft light in darkness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lingering Echo:</strong> Every spell you cast leaves an echo in your voice
                                    for a short time, revealing your spellcasting to those who can interpret it. On the
                                    flip side, your understanding of spell echoes sharpens, granting advantage on Arcana
                                    checks related to identifying spells.</li>
                                <li><strong>Wordbound:</strong> Each spell inscribed on your body pulses with power when
                                    a corresponding spell is cast nearby, causing discomfort but alerting you to the use
                                    of that particular spell within a radius of 60 ft.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inscribed Resilience:</strong> As the power of the inscriptions intensifies,
                                    they start to strengthen your defenses, granting you additional armor equal to the
                                    number of spell words inscribed on you.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scripted Senses:</strong> Your senses become magically heightened, allowing

                                <li><strong>Words of Power:</strong> The inscriptions start to resonate with your own
                                    magic. When you cast a spell that matches an inscription on your body, its potency
                                    increases, adding a bonus to the damage or healing amount.</li>
                                <li><strong>Woven Words:</strong> You can draw power from your inscriptions to cast
                                    spells without expending spell points. once per long rest, you can cast a spell that
                                    matches an inscription on your body for free.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inscribed Protection:</strong> The power of the inscriptions reaches its
                                    peak, creating a barrier around you. You gain immunity to one damage type of a spell
                                    inscribed on your body.</li>
                                <li><strong>Echoing Shield:</strong> Your inscriptions pulse with power whenever a spell
                                    targets you. As a reaction, gain immunity to damage from spells until the end of
                                    your next turn.</li>
                                <li><strong>Word Ascendancy:</strong> You and your inscriptions become one. The words
                                    covering your body shine brilliantly, and your eyes glow with arcane power. You gain
                                    immunity to all spell damage and the ability to cast a spell inscribed on your body
                                    as a reaction.</li>

                        <p>The Inscription of the Infernal is an ancient curse, wherein the Thorned Demon marks its
                            chosen mortal with intricate thorny patterns and diabolical scripts etched into their
                            skin. Initially, the curse brings pain and unease, but as the bearer learns to harness
                            its rage-infused power, they morph pain into a formidable strength.</p>

                        <h2>Technomancer's Oath</h2>
                        <p>The allure of combining arcane magic and technological prowess has enticed you down a
                            dangerous path. Bit by bit, your body is replaced with machinery, your consciousness
                            intertwined with arcane energies and electronic impulses. With each step, the boundary
                            between the physical and digital, the magical and mechanical, blurs.</p>

                        <div class="features">
                            <h4>Curse Progression</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Cybernetic Symbiosis:</strong> Your limbs begin to be replaced by
                                    arcane-imbued technology. Gain advantage on Strength or Agility checks relying on
                                    the replaced limbs. However, take double damage from Lightning damage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Arcane Processor:</strong> A portion of your brain is replaced by a
                                    magic-tech processor. Gain advantage on Intellect and Observation checks, but
                                    exposure to powerful magic or Lightning damage gives you the confused condition for
                                    1 minute.</li>
                                <li><strong>Optical Enhancement:</strong> Your eyes are replaced with advanced optical
                                    sensors. See in dim light as if it were bright light and in complete darkness as if
                                    it were dim light. You can zoom to see far distances. However, flash bangs and
                                    sudden bright magical lights can blind you for 1 minute.</li>
                                <li><strong>Aetheric Heart:</strong> Your heart is replaced with a magical-tech reactor,
                                    removing the need for food and sleep. Gain resistance to poison and disease, but
                                    you're more susceptible to magic drain or anti-magic fields, which cause a random
                                    condition (2) from the table below for 1 minute.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mechano-Magical Network:</strong> Your nervous system is upgraded,
                                    heightening reflexes and magical interaction. Remove the negative effects from the
                                    previous progression steps.</li>

                                <h4>Greater Progression</h4>
                                <p>As you dive deeper into the mysteries of technomancy, the lines blur further. You are
                                    neither fully organic nor fully mechanical, but something new - an embodiment of
                                    magic and machine intertwined. Each upgrade strengthens your control over technology
                                    and magic, granting you unprecedented abilities. However, these steps also mark the
                                    increasing disconnect between your current self and your past humanity, with
                                    vulnerabilities rooted in your dual nature. Harnessing the full potential of this
                                    path may lead to unprecedented power or a profound existential crisis, and it's up
                                    to you to navigate this treacherous journey.</p>
                                <li><strong>Integrated Arcane Arsenal:</strong> Integrate magical weapons into your
                                    mechanized body parts. These weapons can be summoned and dismissed at will.</li>
                                <li><strong>Spectral Firewall:</strong> As a half-action, create a protective arcane
                                    shield around you that prevents the next source of damage until the end of your next
                                    turn.</li>
                                <li><strong>Digital Consciousness:</strong> Upload your consciousness into digital
                                    devices, cybernetics, constructs, or anything else with a tech-magic center. If you
                                    are more powerful, you can overtake or upgrade the device and take control.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mananite Restoration:</strong> Mananites circulate through your body,
                                    rapidly repairing physical damage. Heal 1 hit point every minute and 1 injury every
                                    hour.</li>
                                <li><strong>Singularity Ascension:</strong> Your transformation reaches its zenith as
                                    you become an entity of pure techno-magical energy. Gain the ability to control and
                                    shape arcane-tech devices in your vicinity, but the stability of your new form
                                    heavily relies on the availability of arcane and technological resources.</li>

                    <p>The touch of the damned leaves more than a physical scar; it marks the soul. Infernal Skritches
                        is a potent affliction transmitted through the rending claws and gnashing teeth of true demons.
                        This curse burns away mortal flesh, replacing it with the accursed essence of the abyss.</p>

                            <li><strong>Festering Wound:</strong> The wound festers and burns. Each time the afflicted
                                takes damage, they gain another Infernal wound. Infernal magic becomes more potent, but
                                they suffer disadvantage on Influence and Observation checks due to their partially

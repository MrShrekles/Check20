                    <p>
                        In the diverse world of Shek, equipment is more than just tools; it's an extension of a hero's
                        identity and story. This section offers a variety of equipment options, each with its own
                        history
                        and value. As you prepare for your journey, choose gear that enhances your character's story and
                        prepares them for the challenges of Shek.

                    <h3>Basic Weaponry</h3>
                    <p>
                        Weapons in Shek range from traditional to exotic, classified into two main types based on the
                        required physical attributes: Strength and Agility. This guide simplifies understanding these
                        weapons and their broader applications beyond combat.

                    <h4>Weapon Classification and Mechanics</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the vast world of Shek, weapons are classified into two foundational categories based on the
                        attributes they rely upon:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strength-Based Weapons:</strong> Heavy and powerful weapons like hammers and
                            broadswords, requiring brute force for impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agility-Based Weapons:</strong> Lightweight weapons like daggers, rapiers, and bows,
                            relying on finesse and precision.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standard Weapons:</strong> Basic and simple weapons that can be wielded with either
                            Strength or Agility.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <ul class="weapon-properties">
                            <li><strong>Light:</strong> Lightweight and easy to wield, allowing for quick and fluid
                                movements. Can be dual-wielded or used as an Off-Action.</li>
                            <li><strong>Free Hands:</strong> Your hands are free and not occupied by the weapon.</li>
                            <li><strong>Attached:</strong> This weapon is attached and cannot be disarmed.</li>

                            <li><strong>Range:</strong> Weapons operate within specific ranges:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Melee:</strong> 5ft</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reach:</strong> 10ft</li>

                Damage & Damage Types
            </summary>
            <p>In the world of Shek, numerous damage types exist, each with unique properties and effects. When a
                character rolls a success+ or greater with a weapon or spell, they have the opportunity to roll on
                the associated damage table, leading to a variety of outcomes. Here's an overview of the damage
                types and their potential interactions with armor, wounds, and injuries:
                These are organized by physical, elemental, and Realm Damage types. These are in each category not
                because of the amount of damage they do but what conditions and effects they cause on their damage
                tables. physical damage will often just deal additional damage while Realm Damage can cause
                immediate injuries or banish creatures to alternate planes momentarily.
                If an ability, weapon, gear, spell or whatever says it deals physical damage, it means a physical
                damage type of your choice. Same thing if it says elemental or realm. If you are given a choice at
                the time of creation of an item that usually means that item is locked into that damage type, unless
                you and the narrator determine that it is a shifting item or if it says so in the description.
                A weapon can only have one type of damage. If you have abilities that add damage to a weapon, spell
                or ability then it adds that on and doesn't change the type unless otherwise specified. A glyph can
                change the type of damage on a weapon. When you make a check with multiple successes then the
                weapon‚Äôs damage type is used, not the additional damage types.

                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>‚úä Impact</h4>
                        <p>The raw force of blunt weapons such as hammers, maces, and clubs delivers bone-crushing
                            blows. This type of damage shatters defenses and can leave foes dazed and reeling,
                            representing the sheer power behind a solid, heavy strike.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>üéØ Piercing</h4>
                        <p>Sharp and precise, piercing damage comes from weapons like arrows, spears, and daggers,
                            which are designed to penetrate armor and flesh alike. Each thrust or shot aims for
                            vital points, making it deadly in the hands of a skilled wielder.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>‚öîÔ∏è Slashing</h4>
                        <p>Swords, axes, and claws inflict slashing damage, cutting through flesh and armor with
                            swift, sweeping motions. This type of attack leaves open wounds and bleeding gashes,
                            representing the ferocity and precision of edged weaponry.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Elemental Damage</h3>

                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>üß™ Acid</h4>
                        <p>Corrosive substances eat away at armor and flesh, leaving a sizzling aftermath. Acid
                            damage represents the destructive power of alchemical concoctions, venomous creatures,
                            and spells that dissolve whatever they touch.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>üåë Eclipse</h4>
                        <p>Drawing power from shadows and dark magic, eclipse damage drains the essence of life and
                            light. It encompasses the creeping death of necromancy, the suffocating embrace of
                            smoke, and the chill of pure darkness.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>üî• Fire</h4>
                        <p>Flames and explosions unleash intense heat, burning everything in their path. Fire damage
                            is the fiery fury of magical fireballs, molten lava, and blazing infernos, leaving
                            behind charred remains.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice</h4>
                        <p>The biting cold of ice magic freezes the air and ground, numbing the flesh and slowing
                            movement. Ice damage can encase enemies in frost, rendering them brittle and vulnerable
                            to shattering.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>‚ö° Lightning</h4>
                        <p>Electricity arcs and dances through the air, delivering shocking force. Lightning damage
                            is the power of storms, crackling through the battlefield with speed and precision,
                            often leaving scorch marks in its wake.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>‚òÄÔ∏è Solar</h4>
                        <p>Brilliant light and divine radiance smite the unholy and cleanse the corrupt. Solar
                            damage channels the power of the sun and holy magic, shining brightly to banish darkness
                            and purify evil.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>üå©Ô∏è Thunder</h4>
                        <p>Thunder damage is the concussive force of loud, resonant sounds, capable of shaking the
                            earth and shattering eardrums. It captures the essence of roaring booms, shockwaves, and
                            the wrath of the skies.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>‚ò£Ô∏è Toxic</h4>
                        <p>Poison and radiation inflict toxic damage, seeping into the body and corrupting it from
                            within. It represents the slow, insidious nature of venomous creatures and noxious
                            fumes, capable of weakening the strongest foes.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>üíß Fluid</h4>
                        <p>Water, blood, oil, and other liquids can overwhelm and suffocate. Fluid damage includes
                            the crushing force of tidal waves, the searing burn of boiling liquids, and the
                            asphyxiation of drowning or being engulfed by fluids.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>üåø Nature</h4>
                        <p>Harnessing the primal forces of the natural world, nature damage draws upon plants,
                            animals, and the elements. It can manifest as thorny vines, swarming insects, or the
                            relentless force of wind and rain, often bringing disease and decay to those who fall
                            victim.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <h4>‚ú® Psychic</h4>
                        <p>Psychic damage delves into the mind, bypassing physical defenses to inflict mental
                            torment. It represents telepathic attacks, illusions, and the twisting of thoughts,
                            leaving victims disoriented or shattered mentally.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>‚ò†Ô∏è Vozian</h4>
                        <p>Born from decay, hate, and chaos, Vozian damage embodies the corrupting force of disorder
                            and malevolence. It spreads disease and rot, unraveling order and stability, and often
                            leaves a lingering taint on the soul.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Unlike other damage types, healing repairs and restores, mending wounds and revitalizing
                            the body. It draws upon positive energy and restorative magic, capable of bringing the
                            gravely injured back to health, though it cannot cure conditions or ailments without
                            special intervention.</p>

            <summary>Damage Tables</summary>
            <h1>Damage Tables</h1>
            <p>When you roll a 20 or above on damage, this is termed a "success+". For every "success+" you achieve,
                you're
                granted a roll on the appropriate damage table specific to your weapon. Every 5 above 20 is an
                additional
                success+, so 25 would be 2 rolls, and 30 would be 3. It's vital to remember that different weapons come
                with
                distinct damage tables, so strategic weapon selection can offer unique advantages in combat.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Repeated Conditions</strong>: When you have a repeated, non-stacking condition you deal +1 damage
                instead</p>
            <h3>Special Values</h3>
            <li><strong>Cleave</strong>: deal the half damage to any other targetted creatures within melee range</li>
            <li><strong>Siphon</strong>: heal for the amount listed</li>

                    <p>
                        Firearms are rare and powerful tools in our world, often viewed with suspicion due to their
                        potential for destruction. Most cities and populated areas regulate or even ban their use.
                        Carrying a firearm openly attracts attention, especially from law enforcement or bandits.
                        While
                        firearms provide immense firepower, they come with risks and consequences. If you choose to
                        wield one, do so wisely and carefully.

                    <p>
                        When adventuring, armor is your primary line of defense. It's essential to ally with a
                        blacksmith who can repair and upgrade your gear. In combat, armor absorbs hits before they
                        affect your health. Remember, armor is not destroyed when its protection points are
                        depleted; it
                        simply can't offer protection until repaired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Armor also shields against poison, as venom requires direct contact with the skin to be
                        effective. Be cautious, as wearing too much heavy gear can impose the 'pinned' condition,
                        hindering your movement.

            <h3>Bulk Items</h3>
            <p>
                Bulk represents the weight and space your gear occupies, from negligible trinkets to
                burdensome
                hauls. It's not just about weight but also the size and how cumbersome an item is. Managing
                your
                bulk is crucial for maintaining agility and avoiding encumbrance.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, a watch has 0 Bulk because it can be worn and forgotten about. Meanwhile, an
                empty
                barrel may be light but is awkward to carry, giving it a Bulk of 5.

                <h2>Mounted Combat</h2>
                <p>Mounted combat stands as a thrilling fusion of tradition and innovation. Knights and daredevils
                    alike
                    take to the streets and skies, not on horses, but on mechanized steeds and mystical creatures.
                    Here,
                    a well-timed cavalry charge might be led by a line of sleek motorcycles, while Pegasus-mounted
                    aces
                    could duel among the skyscrapers. In this era, the mounted warrior's valor is matched only by
                    the
                    speed of their mount, be it flesh or steel, feathered or geared.</p>

                <h3>Rules for Mounted Combat</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mount Movement:</strong> The base speed for beasts of burden such as horses is 60
                        ft.
                        Speed for other creatures used as mounts will be determined based on their type and size.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Target Selection:</strong> Enemies may choose to direct their attacks at either you
                        or
                        your mount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dismounting & Mounting:</strong> Exiting your mount requires either the expenditure
                        of
                        20 ft of movement or an action, and the same for mounting a creature or vehicle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mount Abilities:</strong> Different types of mounts provide various abilities and
                        combat
                        options. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Warhorse:</strong> Might grant a charge ability that allows for a powerful
                                attack after moving a certain distance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flying Mount:</strong> Could offer aerial movement options, but with
                                limitations
                                on how long they can stay aloft or how they maneuver.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aquatic Mount:</strong> May allow for swift underwater movement and possibly
                                an
                                evasion bonus due to the fluid environment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Weapon & Armor Crafting</h2>
            <p>In the world of Shek, crafting armor and weapons requires a Forge Workbench, materials (purchased
                or
                scavenged), and skilled hands. Existing mundane items can also be repurposed into new items,
                such as
                converting heavy armor into medium armor or reshaping medium armor into a weapon.</p>

            <h3>Forge Workbench</h3>
            <p>A Forge Workbench is essential for crafting and includes a main station where the crafter makes
                their
                Crafting check. Up to three allies can assist the main crafter using different workstations,
                each

                <h2>Glyphs</h2>
                <p>Glyphs are powerful symbols infused with magic, capable of granting weapons, armor, and even
                    characters with remarkable abilities and enhancements. Through glyphs, a simple piece of
                    gear
                    can become a legendary artifact, and a character may access abilities that significantly
                    alter
                    their role and capabilities within the game.</p>

                <h3>Crafting and Application</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Crafting and applying glyphs require specific materials
                        and
                        a suitable crafting station, such as an enchanting table or magical lab. The rarity of
                        materials and quality of the station can affect the outcome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crafting Process:</strong> Crafters must perform Crafting, Intellect, Spirit, or
                        other related checks. The complexity of the glyph determines the number of successes
                        required.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application Process:</strong> Applying a glyph involves a similar check to
                        integrate
                        the glyph's magical essence fully. Each step takes one hour, with more complex glyphs
                        requiring additional time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Failure:</strong> Failed crafting or application checks can damage or
                        destroy the item, with consequences scaling based on the severity of the failure.</li>
                </ul>

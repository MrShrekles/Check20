            <h2>Spellcasting</h2>
            <p>
                In the intricate dance of spellcasting, every movement and utterance matters. A mage must channel
                their intentions through voice and gesture, like a maestro guiding an orchestra. Yet, magic demands
                clarity. If a caster finds themselves silenced or restrained, the symphony of magic halts. Even
                their gear plays a role; while hands must be free as the wind, a shield may hinder, and armor can
                stifle the very currents of magic they seek to harness.
            </p>
            <div class="features">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Spellcasting requires voice and gesture. Restraints or
                        silence hinders magic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Casting:</strong> Make a Spellcasting check. If you lack a specific Spellcasting
                        check, use a Spirit check. Spells generally require an action to cast or double the spell
                        points for half-actions or off-actions. Add +1 to no-cast spells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeting:</strong> Requires sensory perception of the target.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spell Points:</strong> Recover 1 when you press on and all on a long rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Requires a minimum Spirit check of 2, granting 1 spell
                        point.</li>

                    <p id="basic-spells">
                        Wordless magic is a basic form of spellcasting ideal for non-spellcasters or casting low-cost
                        spells and illusions. It taps into an innate magical source without complex incantations,
                        suitable for subtle, immediate effects.

                                armor (increases by <code>[[1d6]]</code> per spell point) until the end of your next
                                turn. Barriers can be stationary or mobile with the caster and can have their duration
                                extended by 1 minute per spell point.</p>

                                observe a distant familiar location, object, or creature for up to 1 minute. Reveal
                                illusions for an additional +2 points.</p>

                <p>
                    Embrace a revolutionary approach to magic that transcends the mundane confines of traditional
                    spellcraft. Why limit yourself to stale, prewritten incantations that achieve only a singular
                    effect? With dynamic spellcasting, you become the architect of your own spells, focusing on the
                    profound <strong>how</strong> and <strong>what</strong> of your magical endeavors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Manner and Transmission:</strong> Begin by selecting the <strong>Manner</strong>, the
                    method by which your will influences the world. Pair it with a <strong>Transmission</strong>,
                    the elemental or conceptual force you wish to wield.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Declare Your Intent Level:</strong> Choose from six ascending tiers of power, ranging
                    from the gentle Whisper to the awe-inspiring Cataclysm. These levels dictate the magnitude of
                    your spell, scaling from 1 to 24 Spell Points.

                <h3>Spell Calculation</h3>
                <p>
                    Some spellcasters prefer to calculate the true cost of a spell to develop a stronger connection
                    with their magic. The intent system is fine, but they want precise control. Here are the tables
                    and information for spell calculation.
                </p>

                <!-- Spells vs. Abilities -->
                <h4>Spells vs. Abilities</h4>
                <p>
                    All magical effects aren't created equal. While some creatures are innately resistant or immune
                    to certain spells, they might still be susceptible to others, depending on their inherent
                    magical defenses or capabilities. The distinction between what constitutes a spell and what
                    doesn't often lies in the essence of its origin.
                    <br>
                    For instance, a hag's enchantment or a lich's spell is undeniably magical. Conversely, a
                    dragon's fiery breath or the enchantment of a magical sword isn't necessarily a "spell." It's
                    crucial for the Narrator to discern these differences, tailoring their decisions to the
                    situation at hand.
                </p>

                <div class="two-column">

                        <h4>Spellcasting Notes</h4>
                        <h5>Death Condition in Dynamic Magic</h5>
                        <p>
                            To impose the death condition via spellcasting, a significant investment of spell points is
                            required. Costs are determined by the combination of high-cost Manner and Transmission words.
                            Upon casting, the afflicted target can attempt a survival check to resist the spell's effects on
                            their turn. Success depends on the difficulty set by the Narrator, potentially influenced by the
                            target's attributes or the spell's strength.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The use of the death condition spell is carefully regulated by the Narrator to maintain balance
                            and narrative tension, particularly during pivotal encounters. It should not be a trivial or
                            dominant strategy but a deliberate choice with appropriate risks and costs. The death condition
                            may also result from zero wounds, subsequent injury, and further damage, creating a layered
                            approach to combat and spellcasting consequences.
                        </p>
        
                        <!-- Spell Duration -->
                        <h4>How Long a Magic Condition Lasts</h4>
                        <p>
                            In Dynamic Magic, spell duration is influenced by the nature of the spell and the caster's
                            intent. Temporary spells, like those causing prone or pinned conditions, last until the target
                            counters them, such as standing up or making a strength check. These spells can become a battle
                            of wills, with the caster needing to concentrate to maintain their effect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            More severe spells, like those causing broken bones, have longer-lasting impacts that require
                            medical or magical healing. Permanent spells, like those altering terrain or creating objects,
                            remain without ongoing caster focus. Spell duration reflects the caster's purpose, the spell's
                            character, and the balance within the magical world, with some spells easily countered and
                            others leaving lasting effects.
